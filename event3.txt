25670 || International Nesmont Industrial Corp. || Settled 1st part and disbursed || NESFE || September 12, 1994 || May 18, 1998 || 4,200,000 || May 16, 1993  to August 09, 1994 || TBD || ['Suddenly, in a May 26, 1994 press release, the Company began to hint at the true state of affairs underlying its finances and business. The release begins with the Company  emphasizing the positive in that it expected FY93 sales to exceed $70 million, with a modest operating profit. It touted the newly signed refining contracts and said that 1Q94 sales were expected to exceed $30 million compared to $9 million for the first quarter of 1993. Then at the end of the release and contrary to its earlier representations about controls, the company said:  In the course of conducting the audit for the year ended Dec. 31, 1993, Coopers and Lybrand, the auditors for the company, have raised certain issues which are as yet unresolved. The company has engaged Deloitte and Touche to assist it in the resolution of these issues.<p>The company believes the audit will completed shortly and that there will be no material restatement for its year end accounts as prepared by management.<p>The next announcement by Nesmont came on June 20, 1994, where defendants represented that the auditors were going to complete the audit as soon as possible. On the same day,the Board of Directors announced Gunnar Vogel, chairman of Brio Industries, a major Nesmont investor, was appointed to the Board.<p>In a 12 25 Notification of Late Filing filed with the SEC on June 28, 1994, the Company came forward with its first explanation of the accounting system problem:<p>However, the growth of the Company has shown defects in the system when applied to the greater volume of transaction, resulting in inaccurate costing information. This was not known to management as it was localized in one department until the preparation of information for the audit yielded significant inaccuracies from the system generated material.<p>On July 15, 1994, in their six months earnings report for the six months ended June 30, 1994, the Company amplified their explanation of the accounting problem and in the process repeated the accuracy of the financial statements that were operative during the class period:<p>During the auditing process, it became apparent to management that the company\'s computerized accounting system contained certain deficiencies. These deficiencies became particularly obvious as a result of the large increase in the number of transactions the company has been handling in recent months. The company has engaged computer system specialists and outside accounting consultants to assist it in rectifying the deficiencies. Even though the company believes these accounting system deficiencies have no impact on the company\'s reporting of sales, the company will not be able to determine and report other operating results for the current periods or for the year ended Dec. 31, 1993, until the system is corrected. The company believes that the resulting corrections in operating results will show that the company sustained a loss for the  year ended Dec. 31 1993 and possibly for the current six month period.<p>On July 28, 1994, Nesmont announced that the Individual <span onmouseover="showtip2(this,event,\'22\')" onmouseout=" hidetip2()" class=gm>Defendants</span> would be "temporarily relieved" of their management duties, although they would continue to work for the company at full salary. The interim management also suspended the 12/31/93 audit until financial statements could be prepared for the board of directors.<p>On August 1, 1994, Nesmont announced that Ernst & Young had been retained to perform a financial review of the company and make recommendations to the board. It also announced that it had discontinued its financing with Alliance Trade Group and was seeking other sources of money.<p>By this point in time the Company was in full flight, with catastrophic events happening daily. The price of the stock had plummeted to $1.<p>On August 9, 1994, the Company applied to NASDAQ to have its common stock delisted because of its "inability to provide audited financial statements for the year ended Dec. 31 1993, on a timely basis."<p>On August 10, the Board of Directors fired the Individual <span onmouseover="showtip2(this,event,\'22\')" onmouseout=" hidetip2()" class=gm>Defendants</span>, removing them both as officers and directors of the Company.<p>On August 12, 1994, the Company said, in a 6 K filed with the SEC, that the preliminary accountants\' report shows "an apparent overstatement of precious metal inventory handed by its subsidiaries by as much as $7 million, and may Pertain in large part to periods Prior to December 31, 1992. This was the first time it was disclosed that the fraud may extend back over a two year period. The Company also found inadequate documentation with respect to payments made by the Individual <span onmouseover="showtip2(this,event,\'22\')" onmouseout=" hidetip2()" class=gm>Defendants</span> totaling $1,150,000. on the same day, the BC Securities Commission froze the assets of Swissreal Investments, Ltd. and Nesmont Enterprises, Ltd.. On August 26, 1994, Nesmont filed for bankruptcy protection under the companies Creditors Arrangement Act. <p>Finally an additional, even more extraordinary set of facts were made public.
