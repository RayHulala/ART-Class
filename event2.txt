Specifically, the complaint alleges that on Aug. 4, 1997, the American Stock Exchange halted trading of Equisure common stock pending an investigation of the company\'s accounting practices.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that during the investigation, Equisure did not provide the American Stock Exchange with financial records and that Equisure was finally delisted from the American Stock Exchange.<br/><br/>According to the Order entered on December 4, 1997, the Court granted the movant\'s motion for consolidation of the claims against Equisure, Inc. and titled the action "In re Equisure, Inc., Securities Litigation, Master File No. 97-2056 RHK/JMM."
