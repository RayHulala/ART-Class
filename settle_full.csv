The action alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions concerning Apple's improper and undisclosed practice of backdating options conferred on certain executives which made it appear that such options were issued on dates when the market price of Apple stock was higher than actual market price on the actual grant dates. This improper backdating masked the virtually instant profits the option recipients obtained. Under generally accepted accounting principles, these profits were required to be recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements for the appropriate period, but were not. Thus, the Company's financial statements in its Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year 2005 and interim financial statements for 2005 and 2006 were materially false and misleading. In addition, the Company's Proxy Statement for its annual shareholder meeting held in 2006 was materially false and misleading because it contained statements concealing Apple's practice of backdating stock options. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of defendants' actions, plaintiffs and the Class were damaged. According to the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 28, 2008, plaintiffs filed this purported class action on August 24, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors alleging improper backdating of stock option grants to maximize certain defendants profits, failing to properly account for those grants and issuing false financial statements. On January 19, 2007, the Court appointed the New York City Employees Retirement System as lead plaintiff. On March 23, 2007, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. The Consolidated Complaint purports to be brought on behalf of several classes of holders of the Companys stock and asserts claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act as well as state law. The Consolidated Complaint seeks rescission of amendments to various stock option and other incentive compensation plans, an accounting and damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 8, 2007, which was heard on September 7, 2007. On November 14, 2007, the Court issued an order dismissing all securities claims with prejudice, and held that any amended complaint could only be styled as a derivative case. On December 14, 2007, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a first amended consolidated class action complaint. On January 23, 2008, defendants filed an opposition to plaintiff??s motion. Plaintiff??s motion was heard on March 21, 2008. On May 14, 2008, the Court issued an order denying plaintiffs?? motion for leave to amend. The court entered judgment dismissing the case on June 12, 2008. On June 17, 2008, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. According to a press release dated January 28, 2010, Apple Inc. shareholders can refile a securities fraud claim in a group lawsuit against Chief Executive Officer Steve""s and the company alleging stock options manipulation, a federal appeals court ruled. A lower court erred when it decided that the New York City Employees?? Retirement System, the lead plaintiff in the investor lawsuit, couldn??t amend its complaint, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco said in today??s ruling. The appeals court upheld dismissal of""laim that investors were harmed by dilution of their shares. In 2008, a separate lawsuit was filed against Apple Inc. in the Northern District of California (08-CV-03123) claiming only Section 10(b) and 20 allegations.  As the cases progressed they became consolidated under the 2006 case docket. According to a recent news story, plaintiffs filed a class action against Apple, Inc., its CEO, CFO, former general counsel and certain board members for participating in a scheme to file false financial statements, thereby concealing millions of dollars in executive compensation though the backdating of stock option grants.  The report recounts that in June 2006, Apple acknowledged that an internal investigation had revealed irregularities in its stock option grants between 1997 and 2001.  It also said that one of the grants in question was to Mr. Jobs but that ""it was subsequently canceled and resulted in no financial gain to the CEO."" According to the complaint, Apple's share price dropped 14% in the two weeks after Apple's admission, erasing more than $7 billion in share value.  It is this loss that the plaintiffs hope to recover. InformationWeek further recalls that in December 2006, Apple said that as a result of its internal investigation, it would restate its financial results to include ""an additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $84 million after tax [$105 million pretax], including $4 million and $7 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.""  The company said it had found no irregular grants after Dec. 31, 2002. The report relates that the 105-page complaint asserts that Mr. Jobs and the other Apple executives named in the suit knew what was going on.

Plaintiffs' Counsel are hereby awarded 30% of the Gross Settlement Fund in fees, which sum the Court finds to be fair and reasonable, and $23,351.99 in reimbursement of expenses.  According to a press release dated April 7, 2005, Abatix Corp. said Wednesday that it has reached a preliminary agreement to settle a federal class-action shareholder lawsuit and a second suit filed in state District Court in Dallas. Abatix said it has agreed to settle both suits for $900,000. The company has been neck deep in shareholder lawsuits since its shares soared from about $4 to almost $17 in April 2004 and then collapsed to $2. Abatix became the target of five lawsuits involving dozens of shareholders alleging that the company made false statements about RapidCool. Those suits were consolidated into the one federal suit filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas. On May 19, 2004, the plaintiff in the first filed complaint titled Sinay, et al. v. Abatix Corporation, et al., docket number 04-cv-00297, filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and on May 25, 2004, the Court entered the Final Judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice.  By the Order of the Court dated June 21, 2004, the remaining actions pending in the Northern District of Texas were consolidated under the action titled Family Medicine Specialists. et al. v. Abatix Corporation, et al., docket number 04-cv-00872.  Another similar purported class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas was transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The Complaint alleges that defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making a series of materially false and misleading statements concerning the Abatix's business agreement with Goodwin Group LLC during the Class Period. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Abatix knew but failed to disclose certain material facts, including that: (i) the Company had not verified the proprietary nature of RapidCool or that the Company had in fact, obtained the 'exclusive worldwide rights to distribute RapidCool' (ii) that Abatix had not verified that Goodwin Group LLC was the assignee of patents relating to RapidCool products, nor had defendants verified the ownership of any patent applications filed with respect to the product line and (iii) defendants knew but failed to disclose that they had only been permitted to perform limited due diligence on the proprietary nature of RapidCool products before signing the distributorship agreement. As a result, the price of the Company's securities were artificially inflated during the Class Period.  Further, the complaint alleges that on April 21, 2004, the Company admitted that Abatix's April 14, 2004 press release announcing the signing of an agreement with Goodwin Group LLC to distribute the RapidCool (TM) product line created a significant increase in the price and volume of shares traded, 'which the Abatix believes was not warranted by Company developments.'  Note: A number of purported class actions complaints were filed since April 22, 2004. The first complaint was filed on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Abatix's securities between April 14, 2004 at 5:05 p.m. (EST) and April 16, 2004, at 9:27 a.m. (EST). The subsequent complaints were filed on behalf of purchasers of the securities of Abatix between April 14, 2004 at 5:05 p.m. and April 21, 2004, at 8:24 a.m. (EST).

After repeated glowing announcements by Acura to its investors touting the strength of the clinical trials of Acurox and the drug's potential for obtaining FDA approval, and thus commercial viability, the market was stunned when, on April 20, 2010, the FDA posted, on its website, briefing materials for the April 22, 2010 meeting to consider the New Drug Application of Acurox advising that: Acura's Aversion Technology was nowhere near effective enough to warrant approval, that the Company's clinical data was defective, that its clinical studies were not properly designed, that the Company had wholly ignored specific directives from FDA over the past four years as to specific clinical trials and evidence Acura had to demonstrate, and that that no evidence had ever been presented to the FDA that the niacin additive discouraged abusers from abusing oxycodone. On this news, Acura's stock price declined 42.5% in one day, to close at $6.25 in afterhours trading. On April 22, 2010, the FDA Joint Panel voted 19-1 against approving Acurox. On the same day, it was reported that the FDA had been prodding Acura to demonstrate the deterrent efficacy of niacin since at least May 2009. As a result of these disclosures, Acura's stock price declined 39%, to $3.20 per share, in the pre-market trading on April 23, 2010. On January 11, 2011, the Honorable Virginia M. Kendall signed the Memorandum Opinion and Order appointing the Acura Shareholder Investors Group as lead plaintiff and approved its selection of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC as lead counsel.  The lead plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 14, 2011, amending the individual defendants named in the action.  The defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss on May 13, 2011. On October 31, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement and Notice to the Settlement Class.  The Settlement provides for a benefit to the Class in the amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) in cash.  The settlement was preliminarily approved on November 10, 2011.  The Settlement Fairness Hearing is set for February 16, 2012.

AuthentiDate provides web-based content authentication services that address the verification of digital information in all business processes.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and prospects, specifically about revenues to be derived from an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service. The Company also concealed certain internal control problems. These false statements caused AuthentiDate stock to trade at artificially inflated levels, reaching as high as $18.69 per share in January 2004. Taking advantage of this artificial inflation, AuthentiDate completed a private placement of its stock in February 2004, raising $69 million in net proceeds. AuthentiDate's CFO and former CEO also took advantage of the inflation, selling 156,000 shares of their AuthentiDate stock for proceeds of $1.7 million.   On April 13, 2005, AuthentiDate announced the dismissal of its accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Later, on April 29, 2005, AuthentiDate filed a Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing it had hired a new accounting firm and also that on April 15, 2005, its CFO had sent a letter to certain members of the Company's Board of Directors, advising them of the existence of corporate governance issues. The Company hired special counsel to investigate the letter.  Then, the complaint further alleges, on or around May 27, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing that ""its ongoing discussions with the United States Postal Service regarding the status of its Strategic Alliance Agreement had reached a critical stage with the receipt of a second notice from the Postal Service stating that it had failed to attain the performance metrics required by the Strategic Alliance Agreement during the period February 2005 through April 2005."" On this news, AuthentiDate's stock collapsed to $2.94 per share on volume of 1.28 million shares.  As summarized by the Companys Form 10-Q For The Quarterly Period Ended March 31, 2009, between June and August 2005, six purported shareholder class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against our company and certain of its current and former directors and former officers. Plaintiffs in those actions alleged that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The securities law claims were based on the allegations that we failed to disclose that our August 2002 agreement with the USPS contained certain performance metrics, and that the USPS could cancel the agreement if we did not meet these metrics that we did not disclose complete and accurate information as to our performance under, and efforts to renegotiate, the USPS agreement and that when we did disclose that the USPS might cancel the agreement, the market price of our stock declined. On October 5, 2005 the Court consolidated the class actions under the caption In re Authentidate Holding Corp. Securities Litigation., C.A. No. 05 Civ. 5323 (LTS), and appointed the Illinois State Board of Investment as lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint on January 3, 2006, which asserted the same claims as the prior complaints and also alleged that Authentidate violated the federal securities laws by misrepresenting that it possessed certain patentable technology. On July 14, 2006, the Court dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety certain claims were dismissed with prejudice and plaintiff was given leave to replead those claims which were not dismissed with prejudice. In August 2006, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which did not assert any claims relating to the company??s patents or under the Securities Act of 1933, but which otherwise was substantially similar to the prior complaint. The second amended complaint sought unspecified monetary damages. The company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on November 13, 2006.

Park Dental Group (""PDG"") located in Minneapolis-St. Paul area, was one of the dental groups who had a long-term contract agreement with ADPI, and provided ADPI with significant revenue. Indeed, PDG accounted for 29 percent of ADPI's consolidated net revenue in 2006. The business relationship between ADPI and PDG worked well for a number of years, but disputes arose in 2004. In February 2006, PDG sued ADPI and its subsidiary. On December 12, 2007, in connection with the lawsuit a jury found ADPI and/or its subsidiary liable for breach of contract, breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference with contract and prospective advantage. The jury awarded PDG $88 million to compensate it for the injuries caused it by ADPI and its subsidiary and punitive damages of $42 million. After the announcement of the jury verdict, ADPI's stock plummeted from $19.70 a share on December 11, 2007 to $14.34 on December 12, 2007, to $4.62 on December 13, 2007 after the announcement of the punitive damage award.

This motion was fully briefed and oral argument occurred. The motion was still pending at the time of reaching this Settlement. The original complaint charges Aetna and certain of its officers and directors with issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market before and during the Class Period, thereby artificially inflating the price of Aetna common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Aetna issued statements concerning, among other things, the ability of Aetna to control and monitor its costs and obligations in light of the Company's expected and actual sales. Defendants knew that Aetna's management systems, procedures and controls for monitoring such costs were lacking but they made positive statements about Aetna's management, controls, and abilities to control costs while concealing the defective management systems. Between April 10, 2001 and May 8, 2001, Aetna surprised the market by announcing higher-than-anticipated medical costs during the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, faulty record-keeping which caused the payment of millions of dollars in medical claims for former clients, and the absence of necessary management control systems required for management to know Aetna's obligations and proper medical costs.

Judge Henry C. Morgan then approved a $5 million settlement in the suit filed by a group of shareholders against the Virginia Beach-based managed-care provider. When informed of the agreement that lead plaintiff Illinois State Board of Investment struck with Amerigroup in October, Morgan had not yet decided on an Amerigroup motion seeking a summary judgment, the judge said during a hearing to determine the fairness of their agreement. A summary judgment, which defendants often seek before a suit is scheduled to go trial, would have resolved the case in Amerigroup's favor. The motion ""certainly was something the court would have considered,"" Morgan said. Attorneys for the Illinois investment board expressed doubt about being able to gather enough evidence to defeat Amerigroup's motion or to win at trial when they asked the court in January to approve the settlement. In a press release dated January 24, 2007, Plaintiffs' attorneys who pursued a securities -fraud lawsuit against Amerigroup Corp. are seeking $500,000, a 10 percent share of the $5 million that Amerigroup agreed to pay to end the class - action case. Attorneys for the lead plaintiff, Illinois State Board of Investment, and Amerigroup, a Virginia Beach-based provider of managed care to the indigent, agreed to a settlement in October while sparring over access to additional Amerigroup documents.  In to a press release dated December 28, 2006, the action has been certified as a class action for settlement purposes only and that a Settlement valued at $5 million has been proposed. A hearing will be held before the Honorable Henry Coke Morgan, U.S.D.J., in the Walter E. Hoffman United States Courthouse, 600 Granby Street, Norfolk, Virginia 23510, at 11:00 a.m., on February 5, 2007 to determine whether the proposed Settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and to consider the application of Lead Counsel for attorneys' fees and/or reimbursement of expenses. In a press release dated October 27, 2006, Amerigroup Corp., citing the legal expense, inconvenience and distraction of continuing litigation, said Thursday that it agreed to settle a fraud suit brought by shareholders in U.S. District Court in Norfolk. The Illinois State Board of Investment and four other plaintiffs contended that they had been defrauded last year by relying on Amerigroup's financial projections before the company reported a loss for the third quarter of 2005 and its stock price plunged. The plaintiffs, led by the Illinois investment board, alleged that Amerigroup officers had excluded certain costs as a way to make the company's earnings appear stronger than they were. The plaintiffs had demanded a jury trial. Amerigroup, a Virginia Beach-based company that specializes in providing managed care to recipients of Medicaid and other government health care programs, said the settlement calls for creation of a $5 million fund to end all claims against the company. The agreement, it said, also calls for claims brought against individuals named in the suit to be dismissed. The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including execution of a definitive agreement and court approval, Amerigroup said. The cost, it said, will be borne by its insurer. As disclosed by the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006, beginning on October 3, 2005, five purported class action complaints (the Actions) were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District.  On January 10, 2006, the Court issued an order (i) consolidating the Actions (ii) setting Illinois State Board of Investment v. AMERIGROUP Corp., et al., Civil Action No. 2:05-cv-701 as lead case for purposes of trial and all pretrial proceedings (iii) appointing Illinois State Board of Investment (ISBI) as Lead Plaintiff and its choice of counsel as Lead Counsel and (iv) ordering that Lead Plaintiff file a Consolidated Amended Complaint (CAC) by February 24, 2006. On February 24, 2006, ISBI filed the CAC, which purports to allege claims on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the Companys common stock from February 16, 2005 through September 28, 2005. On October 25, 2006, the Company reached an agreement in principle to resolve the Actions by executing a memorandum of understanding (the MOU) with the Lead Plaintiff. Under the terms of the MOU, a settlement fund of $5,000,000 in cash is expected to be created by the Companys insurance carrier to resolve all class claims against the Company. All claims asserted against the individuals named in the lawsuit have been dismissed. Accordingly, the Company is the only remaining defendant. On November 13, 2006, the Company and the Lead Plaintiff executed and filed the definitive settlement agreement with the Court. The definitive settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Court. There can be no assurance that the settlement will receive the Courts approval. The original complaint charges AMERIGROUP and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AMERIGROUP operates as a multi-state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs, such as Medicaid, State Childrens Health Insurance Program and FamilyCare.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants caused AMERIGROUPs shares to trade at artificially inflated levels by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company??s financial statements, business and prospects, specifically by failing to account for at least $23 million in medical costs incurred in prior quarters but not included in the results for those",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

These suits were settled earlier in 2005, and were approved by the United States District Court and the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida, respectively, in November 2005, subject to possible objection and appellate review, if any, before the end of December 2005. There were no timely objections raised or appeals filed in connection with the settlements of the suits.  In a press release dated September 9, 2005, a hearing will be held on November 18, 2005 at 1:30 p.m. in Courtroom 14A, Sam M. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse, 801 North Florida Avenue, Tampa, FL 33602 to determine: (1) whether to certify the above-captioned action (""Action"") as a class action and appoint Class Representatives and their counsel to represent Class Members (2) whether the proposed settlement (the ""Settlement"") of the above-captioned action (""Action"") for $5,350,000 in cash plus accrued interest (the ""Settlement Fund"") should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate (3) whether to approve a plan to allocate the available Settlement Fund among Class Members who submit timely and valid claims (4) whether the motion of Lead Plaintiffs' Counsel for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of costs and expenses and for an award to Lead Plaintiffs for costs and expenses should be approved and (5) whether the Action should be dismissed with prejudice and claims, including claims asserted in this Action, derivative claims, and other claims, should be released and barred, as to and between all of the defendants and related persons and entities. In a press release dated April 5, 2005, Aerosonic Corporation announced that it and the other parties to the Aerosonic Corporation Securities Litigation filed a Notice of Settlement with the court on April 1, 2005, confirming that all parties had executed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") to settle its pending class action litigation. The MOU defines a total settlement of $5.35 million, of which Aerosonic will pay $800,000. This settlement is contingent upon preliminary and final court approval and could be voided if opt-outs exceed a certain agreed-upon threshold.  The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between May 3, 1999 and March 17, 2003, thereby artificially inflating the price of Aerosonic common stock. The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants issued numerous statements and filed quarterly and annual reports with the SEC which described the Company's financial performance. As alleged in the complaint, these statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts, among others: (i) that the Company had materially falsified its inventory records and improperly recognized revenues (ii) that the Company's financial returns were in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures  ('GAAP') (iii) that the Company lacked adequate internal  controls and was therefore unable to ascertain the true financial condition of the Company and (iv) that as a result, the value of the Company's net income and financial results was materially overstated at all relevant times.  Further, the Complaint alleges that on March 17, 2003, Aerosonic announced that it had discovered what appeared to be certain discrepancies which pertain to previously reported financial information concerning inventory accounting and revenue recognition. The market reacted swiftly to this news, with the Company's stock falling 24%, or $3.32 per share from a high of $13.32 per share on March 17, 2003 to close at $10.10 per share on March 18, 2003.",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

In October 2006, the parties held talks to settle the matter, and on Feb. 6, 2008, they signed a stipulation of settlement, resolving the case for $2,000,000.  The Court of Appeals accordingly has remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of the settlement.  The settlement is subject to various conditions, including without limitation, approval of the District Court.   According to the latest docket posted, on November 17, 2005, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the October 20, 2005 Memorandum and Opinion dismissing the complaint.  The appeal is currently pending in the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Complaint alleges that Abercrombie (a) carried out a scheme to deceive the investing public (b) made untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading and (c) engaged in acts, practices, and a course of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers of the Company's securities in an effort to maintain artificially high market prices for Abercrombie securities. More specifically, the Complaint alleges that during the class period, Abercrombie made positive public announcements about its monthly and quarterly sales results while, at the same time they did not reveal that the Company's margins, a material indicator of the Company's true financial condition, would be lower in its 2005 second fiscal quarter. In July 2005, Abercrombie's Chairman and CEO sold more than 1.6 million shares of Abercrombie common stock reaping $118 million in profits based on negative, material Company information known to him, but unknown to Plaintiff and the Class. Following the revelation of the material, undisclosed information, Abercrombie's common stock price plummeted, resulting in substantial losses to shareholders. As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 29, 2006, in September and October of 2005, six purported class actions were filed against A&F and other defendants in the same Court.

On November 1, 2005, a motion to consolidate all these purported class actions into the first-filed case was filed by some of the plaintiffs. A&F joined in that motion. On March 22, 2006, the motions to consolidate were granted, and these actions (together with the federal court derivative cases) were consolidated for purposes of motion practice, discovery and pretrial proceedings. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on August 14, 2006. On October 13, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. According to an article dated August 13, 2007, the federal judge overseeing consolidated securities litigation against Abercrombie & Fitch Co. over allegations that the clothing retailer concealed evidence of diminishing sales has rejected the defendants' bid for dismissal. U.S. District Judge Edmund A.

In its defense, Applied Signal said the plaintiffs had not sufficiently established that the company had even received three of the four stopwork orders or that these orders put a stop to work accounted for in the backlog.  But the appeals court rejected the argument, noting that the suit identified four employee witnesses who would testify to the existence of the disputed stopwork orders.  ??Defendants quibble that these witnesses weren't in a position to see the stopwork orders firsthand because they were 'engineers or technical editors' rather than managers.

For the case first filed on April 4, 2008, in the Southern District of Florida, titled John J. McIlvaine, et al. v. ArthroCare Corporation, et al., case number 08-CV-80343, on April 7 and May 2, 2008, the defendants filed two motions to dismiss the complaint.  On June 4, 2008, the motions were denied as moot.  On July 17, 2008, Senior Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp granted the motion to appoint the Iron Workers Fund as lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiffs selection of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as lead counsel.  On September 10, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to change venue.  On October 17, 2008, the lead plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint. On October 28, 2008, Senior Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp granted the motion to change venue to the Western District of Texas - Austin. For the case filed on July 25, 2008, in the Western District of Texas, titled James Strong, et al. v. ArthroCare Corporation, et al., case number 08-CV-00574, on August 27, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  On October 28, 2009, Judge Sam Sparks issued the Order consolidating the two actions pending in the Western District of Texas under lead case Strong v. ArthroCare Corp., et al., Civil Action 08-CV-00574.  On November 25, 2008, Judge Sparks issued the Order on the defendant??s motion to dismiss.

Throughout the Class Period, Arotech presented itself as a company that was adept at managing and integrating acquired assets (such as Armour of America, which it acquired in August 2004 at a cost of approximately $22 million), and a company that was achieving organic growth. Moreover, throughout that time, defendants repeatedly stated that Arotech maintained systems, procedures and controls that foreseeably would allow it to achieve remarkable year-over-year ""record"" quarterly revenue growth as high as 40%. Defendants' representations concerning Arotech's business, management capabilities, systems and controls, and strength and profitability were either knowingly false when made or defendants recklessly disregarded known, material adverse facts at the time the statements were made. In reality, throughout the Class Period, the Company was suffering from a host of undisclosed adverse factors that were negatively impacting Arotech's business and that would foreseeably cause it to report declining financial results - - materially less than the market expectations defendants had caused and cultivated. It was only at the end of the Class Period that investors ultimately learned the truth - - that the Company was operating far below expectations and that Arotech had significantly under-reserved for its impaired assets. These sudden and shocking disclosures, first reported on November 14, 2005, had an immediate impact on the price of Arotech stock. Accordingly, the following day, on November 15, 2005, shares of the Company declined almost 27% in the single trading day. The complaint alleges that defendants were motivated to and did conceal the true operational and financial condition of Arotech, and materially misrepresented and failed to disclose the conditions that were adversely affecting Arotech throughout the Class Period, because this allowed defendants to. (i) deceive the investing public regarding Arotech's business, operations, management and the intrinsic value of Arotech common stock (ii) register for sale with the SEC millions of shares of Company stock and to arrange for financing upon preferential terms not otherwise available and (iii) cause plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Arotech common stock at artificially-inflated prices. Two similar securities class action complaints were filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District Of New York. On June 4, 2007, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.  The case first filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan is closed.  The action is continuing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Morris Akerman, et al. v. Arotech Corporation, et al.  On July 3, 2007, the Court entered an Order granting the motion to consolidate two related actions, to appoint lead plaintiffs and to approve selection of co-lead counsel. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Complaint on September 28, 2007.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 28, 2008.  On March 30, 2009, Chief Judge Raymond J. Dearie signed the Memorandum and Order denying the defendants?? motion to dismiss the complaint.  The parties soon after engaged in discovery proceedings. According to a press release dated January 13, 2010, Arotech Corporation announced that it has reached an agreement with lead plaintiffs to settle the consolidated putative securities class-action lawsuit originally filed in March 2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice, and Arotech and all current and former officers and directors named in the complaint will receive a full and complete release of all claims asserted against them in the litigation, as well as any related claims that could have been asserted. The claims will be settled for $2.9 million. The monetary payment to be made on behalf of Arotech and the individual defendants will be funded entirely from insurance proceeds.

Among other things, plaintiff claims that defendants' material omissions and dissemination of materially false and misleading statements concerning the Company's business, operations and prospects, caused AtriCure's stock price to become artificially inflated, inflicting damages on investors.  AtriCure is a medical device company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac surgical ablation systems designed to create precise lesions, or scars, in cardiac tissue. The Complaint alleges that defendants fraudulently inflated AtriCure's securities prices by improperly promoting its products to physicians and improperly causing the filing of false claims for reimbursement. On October 31, 2008, AtriCure shocked investors when the Company revealed that it had received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice - Civil Division (the ""DOJ"") informing the Company that the DOJ was conducting an investigation for potential False Claims Act and common law violations relating to the Company's surgical ablation devices. AtriCure further disclosed that, specifically the DOJ was investigating the Company's marketing practices utilized in connection with AtriCure's surgical ablation system to treat atrial fibrillation, a specific use outside the Federal Food and Drug Administration's 510(k) clearance. Moreover, the Company revealed that the DOJ was investigating whether AtriCure instructed hospitals to bill Medicare for surgical ablation using incorrect billing codes. As a result of this news, the Company's shares declined $2.53 per share, or 39.41 percent, to close on November 3, 2008, at $3.89 per share, on unusually heavy trading volume. On February 17, 2009, the court consolidated related cases, appointed lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel. On May 08, 2009, amended class action complaint for violations of the federal securities laws against all defendants, was filed by all plaintiffs. On March 29, 2010, an order was entered granting the motion to strike and granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. On July 30, 2010, the parties consented to the entry of an Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement and Directing Notice and Settlement Hearing.

Plaintiffs counsel are awarded $150,000.00 as fees & $545,533.10 as reimbursement for expenses. According to a press release dated August 3, 2005, A.T. Cross Company announced that the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted preliminary approval of an agreement to settle the securities class action litigation currently pending against the Company and certain present and former officers and directors. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the class action litigation will be dismissed in exchange for an aggregate cash payment of $1.5 million. The settlement payment will be funded entirely by the Company's insurance carriers and will therefore have no impact to the Company's P&L. The settlement remains subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including final approval by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island following notice to members of the class. As summarized in the Companys FORM 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005,  on June 30, 2000, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the action in the United States District Court in Rhode Island. The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the Company's Motion to Dismiss in June 2001. In July 2001, the Plaintiff filed an appeal with the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was before the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held February 8, 2002. On March 20, 2002, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a judgment affirming the dismissal of all claims asserted against the W. Russell Boss Jr. Trust A, W. Russell Boss Jr. Trust B and W. Russell Boss Jr. Trust C and reversing the District Court's dismissal of the Section 10(b) and 20(a) claims asserted against the Company and the named individual defendants. The Court of Appeals' ruling was limited to a finding that the plaintiff's complaint had satisfied the pleading requirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 the Court did not opine on the merits of plaintiff's claims. On January 8, 2004, the District Court heard oral argument on defendants' motion for summary judgment. On July 21, 2004, the Court issued its Memorandum and Order partially granting defendants' motion for summary judgment and narrowing the class period to encompass only purchases made between July 16, 1998 and April 22, 1999.

AXT, Inc. et al., No. C 04 4362 MJJ. The lawsuit complaint names AXT, Inc. and the Companys former chief technology officer as defendants, and is brought on behalf of a class of all purchasers of the Companys securities from February 6, 2001 through April 27, 2004. The complaint alleges that the Company announced financial results during this period that were false and misleading. No specific amount of damages is claimed. On September 23, 2005, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss the complaint, with leave to amend. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company had moved to dismiss. On April 24, 2007, the Company reached a settlement of this litigation. On February 27, 2008, the district court approved the settlement, and subsequently entered a judgment of dismissal. According to the Stipulation of Settlement, the Settlement Fund consists of $2,575,000 in cash. The original complaint charges AXT and the Company's CEO with violations of federal securities laws. Plaintiff claims defendants' omissions and ""aterial misrepresentations concerning AXT's operations and performance during the Class Period artificially inflated the Company's stock price, inflicting damages on investors. AXT manufactures semiconductor parts known as substrates for a variety of electronic products including wireless and fiber optic telecommunications, lasers, light emitting diodes and consumer electronics.  More specifically, the complaint alleges defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that their statements were materially false and misleading when made because AXT: (i) did not follow requirements for testing of products (and provision of testing data and information) relating to customer requirements and, as a consequence of this conduct, (ii) failed to accrue adequate reserves (iii) falsely stated its reported reserves, revenue and income and (iv) issued false statements about the Company meeting customer requirements.

A hearing will be held before the Honorable Andre M. Davis in the United States District Court, Garmatz Federal Courthouse, Suite 4415, 101 West Lombard St., Baltimore, MD 21201, at 11:00 a.m., on July 14, 2006 to determine whether the proposed settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and to consider the application of Plaintiffs' Counsel for attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses.   In a press release dated September 30, 2005, Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE) has agreed to settle a consolidated securities class action lawsuit pending against the company and certain former officers, according to a regulatory filing Friday. Under the proposed settlement, the action will be dismissed with prejudice in exchange for $15.05 million in cash, which will be made by the utility holding company's insurance carrier. Allegheny also said it will settle related shareholder derivative actions for $450,000, also to be paid by insurance. In addition, the company agreed to adopt certain corporate governance changes.  Several, similar purported class action law suits were also filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  On April 22, 2003, class action lawsuits that were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York were Ordered to be transferred to the District of Maryland, managed under Multi-District Litigation. On March 16, 2001, Allegheny Energy's subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC (""Allegheny Energy Supply"") announced that it completed its acquisition of Global Energy Markets (""G.E.M."") from Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.  (""Merrill Lynch"").  The complaint alleges that Allegheny Energy made false and misleading statements during the Class Period in that it omitted to state that its revenues (and revenue guidance) materially depended, on illusory, revenue  creating, ""wash transactions"" with Enron, and other deceptive energy trading  practices.  At no point did Allegheny Energy disclose to the investing public  that:  (i) the surge in its revenues was attributable to G.E.M.'s practice of  engaging in deceptive and illusory trades and (ii) that after the Enron story  broke, Allegheny Energy could no longer engage in these deceptive trading  practices as successfully, and that revenues would drop as a result. On September 25, 2002, the Company sued Merrill Lynch for fraud and breach of  contract related to the G.E.M. acquisition.  In that lawsuit, Allegheny Energy  alleged that it overpaid for G.E.M. because the unit's financial reports had  been inflated by sham trades involving Enron.  The Company admitted that G.E.M engaged in a significant amount of wash or round trip energy trades with Enron, and perhaps others.  The Company further admitted that the effect of those trades was to artificially inflate revenues, trading volumes and growth rate. The Company's September 25, 2002 admissions set a chain of events in motion, which would result in the Company's stock's tumble from a high of $12.85 on September 25, 2002 to $3.80 on October 8, 2002 -- a drop of $9.05, or 70%.  On October 1, 2002, Moody's downgraded Allegheny Energy's credit to junk status.  The Company, in a press release, reassured investors that this would not trigger any default or prepayment of the firm's debt.  A week later, on October 8, 2002, the Company announced that it was in technical default under its credit agreements.",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The complaint alleges that on January 16, 2009, Bank of America disclosed Merrill Lynch's preliminary 2008 fourth quarter loss of $15.3 billion. Merrill Lynch's fourth quarter 2008 ""principal transactions"" revenue was negative $13.1 billion, reflecting a net loss owing to write-downs, mark-to-market valuation declines and other losses on assets held in its trading portfolio.  It is alleged that as a result of this massive loss Bank of America was compelled to seek additional funding and asset guarantees from the United States Treasury Department. Following these disclosures, Bank of America shares declined by 31% between January 14, 2009 and January 16, 2009. The complaint charges that the Proxy Statement contained material misrepresentations and failed to disclose facts necessary to make the disclosures true. Specifically, defendants' misrepresentations and omissions include the failure to update, amend or correct the Proxy Statement to reflect, among other things, the risk or existence of Merrill Lynch's fourth quarter losses, prior to the December 5, 2008 vote by Bank of America shareholders to approve the Merger. Similar class action complaints have also been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern Districts of Georgia and California and the District of Kansas. According to the June 30, 2009, Opinion signed by Judge Denny Chin, the securities, derivative, and ERISA actions are each separately consolidated.  The Public Pension Fund group is appointed lead plaintiff in the securities actions, and its choice for lead counsel is approved. The Institutional Group is appointed interim lead plaintiff in the derivative actions and KSF and Saxena White are appointed interim co-lead counsel. Harwood Feffer, Squitieri & Fearon, and Hagens Berman are appointed interim co-lead counsel in the ERISA actions. On July 30, 2009, the Court entered the Consolidation Order signed by Judge Denny Chin.  According to the Order, the Securities Actions are consolidated into Master File No. 09 MDL 2058 (DC) for all purposes including, but not limited to, pretrial proceedings (including any discovery), and any trial. However, Bahnmaier, as an individual action, is consolidated for pretrial proceedings only pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ?? 1407(a) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 (a). The docket in Master File No. 09 MDL 2058 DC shall constitute the Master Docket for the Securities Actions.  Every pleading in the Securities Actions shall bear the following caption: In Re Bank Of America Corp. Securities, Derivative, And Employment Retirement Income Act (ERISA) Litigation. On September 25, 2009, the lead plaintiffs filed Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, naming a number of additional defendants and claims to the action.  On November 24 and December 8, 2009, the defendants filed several motions to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. On December 22, 2009, the Iron Workers of Western Pennsylvania Pension Plan and MARTA/ATU Local 732 Employees Retirement Plan (the ""ron Workers plaintiffs"") filed a class action complaint on behalf of holders of debt securities against BoA and other defendants for alleged misstatements and omissions in connection with BOA'S merger with Merrill. (No. 09 Civ. 10394). On February 22, 2010, the Iron Workers plaintiffs filed a motion for appointment as lead plaintiffs and the appointment of their attorneys as lead counsel. On January 3, 2010, Charles Dornfest filed a class action complaint on behalf of options investors against BoA and other defendants for alleged misstatements and omissions in connection with BOA'S merger with Merrill. (No. 10 Civ. 275).  On March 2, 2010, a case was filed titled Kenneth A. Ciullo, et al. v. Bank of America, et al., case number 10-CV-01673.  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This action arises out of the dissemination of materially false and misleading statements and omissions by defendants concerning the financial conditions of BAC and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (""Merrill"") and regarding BAC's acquisition of Merrill (the ""Merger""). As a result of defendants' false and misleading statements, BAC options traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants made materially misleading statements to investors concerning, among other things, Merrill's fourth quarter losses, Merrill's and BAC's true financial condition, and that BAC had secretly agreed to allow Merrill to pay its executives billions of dollars in bonuses on an accelerated schedule. In response to disclosures made concerning the Merrill bonuses, the mounting losses at Merrill, and the deteriorating financial condition of BAC, the price of BAC options fell significantly resulting in damages to BAC options investors. On March 16, 2010, the Ciullos moved for consolidation with the Dornfest action only, and for appointment as lead plaintiffs. According to the Memorandum Decision entered on April 12, 2010, the Iron Workers, Dornfest, and Ciullo arise out of the same facts and circumstances relating to BOA'S acquisition of Merrill as are at issue in the Consolidated Securities Actions. The cases are substantially similar and, except perhaps with respect to damages, raise the same issues of fact and law. Hence, the three cases should be consolidated into the Consolidated Securities Actions (No. 09 MDL 2058).  The plaintiffs in Iron Workers, Dornfest, and Ciullo are free to pursue their claims as individual cases - but not as class actions.  The motions of the plaintiffs in these three cases for appointment as lead plaintiffs and the appointment of their counsel as lead counsel are denied. According to an article dated August 30, 2010, in an August 27, 2010 opinion so massive that its table of contents alone is five pages long, Southern District of New York Judge Kevin Castel granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss in the consolidated securities and derivative litigation arising from Bank of Americas January 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch and related events. Though the opinion dismisses parts of the lawsuit, other substantial pieces, particularly those related to the controversial bonuses paid to Merrill employees at the end of 2008, will be going forward. On October 22, 2010, the lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Class Action Complaint.  The defendants responded by filing several motions to dismiss on  November 29, 2010. According to the Memorandum and Order signed by Judge P. Kevin Castel on July 29, 2011, the defendants motion to dismiss is granted as to plaintiffs Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim directed toward non-disclosure of federal financial assistance. The motion also is granted as to plaintiffs standing to pursue claims on behalf of holders of BofA preferred shares, debt securities and call options, and only those claims brought on behalf of holders of CUSIP 060505DP6 bonds and January 2011 call options may proceed. The defendants motion is denied as to plaintiffs Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims directed to non-disclosure of Merrills losses in the fourth quarter of 2008.   The parties have been ordered to complete class certification discovery no later than October 3, 2011. Plaintiffs may move for class certification no later than October 17, 2011.  The plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class on October 17, 2011. On April 12, 2012, the Court issued an order granting defendants' motions to dismiss claims unique to an individual plaintiff.  The plaintiff's application for leave to replead was denied. On May 29, 2011, a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal without Prejudice was submitted by the plaintiff against one of the individual defendants. On July 26, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Consolidated Complaint against all of the Defendants. On the next day, an amended complaint was also filed on this docket. On August 30, 2012, a Stipulation of Voluntary Partial Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(I) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs dismiss with prejudice, their claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. On November 30, 2012, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Settlement.  On December 4, the Court entered an Order preliminarily approving the settlement.  On April 8, 2013, the Court issued the Judgment Approving Class Action Settlement.  On April 8, 2013, the Court issued an Order awarding attorneys' fees and expenses for co-lead counsel. On April 23, 2013, members of the class filed a Notice of Appeal, appealing the Court's April 8 decision approving the settlement.  The next day, one of the plaintiffs filed a separate Notice of Appeal, also appealing the settlement approval. On April 25, 2013, the Court issued an Order granting the defendants' motions to dismiss in two separate derivative actions.

BigBand, certain of its officers and directors, and the Company's underwriters -- collectively, ""defendants"" -- are charged with including, or allowing the inclusion of, materially false and misleading statements in the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The Complaint charges that BigBand raised over $159 million through the sale of 10.7 million shares, despite the Registration Statement's false and misleading statements issued in connection with the IPO. Specifically, the Complaint charges defendants with failing to adequately conduct a due diligence investigation into the Company prior to the IPO, and that they failed to reveal BigBand was not performing according to plan, lacked significant controls and procedures, and lacked any reasonable basis to forecast near-term foreseeable financial and operational results. The Complaint further alleges that defendants failed to reveal the Company's results were already underperforming expectations at the time of the IPO, and that they had boosted the financial results of the quarter immediately prior to the offering by loading customers with unnecessary inventory -- such that sales in future quarters would foreseeably be adversely impacted as customers ""worked off"" excess inventory prior to purchasing more of BigBand's products. Additionally, the Complaint asserts that defendants failed to disclose that the roll out of its new products was not proceeding according to its growth plan, and that this transition too was adversely impacting revenues in the near-term. On September 28, 2007, BigBand shares fell over 30% in a single trading day -- falling from over $9.00 per share to below $6.00 per share, before closing at $6.49 on exceptionally heavy trading volume of almost 7 million shares. This precipitous decline occurred after the truth was revealed to investors the previous evening that the problems existing at the time of the IPO, and detailed in the Complaint, would result in extremely disappointing results for the third quarter of 2007, including substantially reduced revenues. On February 14, 2008, the Court entered the Orders granting the motion to consolidate the cases and granting the motion to appoint Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel. On May 30, 2008, a Consolidated Class Action Complaint was filed by the plaintiff, adding violations of ??12(a)(2) of the Securities Act to the list of counts.  On August 8, 2008, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On February 23, 2009, District Court Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong denied the two pending motions to dismiss, without prejudice to refilling. On April 6, 2009, a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement was filed.  The proposed settlement is in the amount of $11 million in cash.  On June 1, 2009, Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong granted the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement.  A Settlement Fairness Hearing was set for September 15, 2009.

A hearing will be held before the Honorable Laura Taylor Swain, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007-1581 at 2:30 p.m. on January 13, 2006 to determine whether the proposed Settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and to consider the application of Lead Counsel for attorneys' fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses.  In a press release dated August 31, 2005, Bennett Environmental Inc. announced that it had reached an agreement in principle to settle the previously disclosed consolidated securities class action against it and certain of its present or former officers that is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Under the proposed settlement, all claims asserted against the Company and the other named defendants in that action will be dismissed with prejudice with no admission or finding of wrongdoing on the part of any defendant. The proposed settlement will provide for an aggregate cash payment to class members of US$9.75 million, which will be paid primarily by the Company's insurance carriers with a contribution of US$750,000 to come from the Company. The proposed settlement is subject to negotiation of definitive settlement documents and preliminary and final court approvals following notices to shareholders and members of the class. The complaint alleges that, throughout the relevant time period, defendants misrepresented the financial condition of the company by stating that the largest contract in the company??s history was in full force and effect when, in fact, the contract had been substantially withdrawn almost immediately after its execution. Canadian investors are included in this action. The complaint charges individual defendants with violations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 19"" for making allegedly false and misleading statements which caused Bennett common stock to trade at artificially inflated levels during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants repeatedly touted that Bennett had been awarded a ""record"" contract - the ""largest in the Company's history"" - to treat ""300,000 tons"" of contaminated soil from a large hazardous waste site in New Jersey - that was expected to generate more than $200 million (CDN) in revenues for the Company (the ""New Jersey Contract""). The complaint further alleges that on July 22, 2004, Bennett revealed that: (a) the Company would not be receiving the 300,000 tons of soil or $200 million (CDN) in revenues for soil treatment under the New Jersey Contract (b) shortly after the New Jersey Contract was awarded to Bennett in May 2003, Bennett's consent to perform under the contract had been withdrawn by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the ""Corps"") which supervises the contractors responsible for the remediation process at the New Jersey site (c) the Corps agreed to ship only up to 10,000 tons of soil from the clean-up site to Bennett (d) only ""about 7,000 tons"" of contaminated soil had been treated by Bennett under the New Jersey Contract and ""future deliveries under it are highly unlikely to resume"" (e) on June 3, 2004, Bennett had entered into a new subcontract for soil treatment on economic terms ""far less"" favorable than those in the New Jersey Contract and with a guaranteed minimum of only 1,000 tons of soil and (f) operations at the Company's highly publi",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0
102988,BEN,6/9/2011,2/4/2004,2011,6,2682,6282,7.8943181,2.75,BEN,"According to the fund's annual report for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, More than 400 similar lawsuits against at least 19 different mutual fund companies have been filed in federal district courts throughout the country. Because these cases involve common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the Judicial Panel) ordered the creation of a multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, entitled In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation (the MDL). The Judicial Panel then transferred similar cases from different districts to the MDL for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.  Plaintiffs in the MDL filed consolidated amended complaints on September 29, 2004. On February 25, 2005, defendants filed motions to dismiss. The Companys and its subsidiaries motions are currently under submission with the court. The case was received by the Multi District Panel for the District Court of Maryland on May 14, 2004 where progress in the litigation appears to have stalled.  The final substantive activity took place on March 5, 2007 with a motion to stay proceedings against defendant Banc of America Securities, LLC. in light of a pending settlement.  No further information regarding this settlement has been released. According to a press release dated February 9, 2004, the complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. On May 3, 2004, the judge entered an order transferring the case to the District Court of Maryland to be included in the large-scale mutual funds Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceedings. Specifically, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, certain of the defendants failed to disclose that they improperly allowed certain favored investors, including Calugar, SBI, and DCIP, to engage in 'timing' of the Funds' securities. Timing is excessive, arbitrage trading undertaken to turn a quick profit and which ordinary investors are told that the funds police. Timing injures ordinary mutual fund investors -- who are not allowed to engage in such practices -- and are acknowledged as improper practices by the Funds. In return for receiving extra fees from Calugar, SBI, and DCIP, and other favored investors, Franklin Resources and its affiliates allowed and facilitated timing activities in the Funds, to the detriment of class members, who paid, dollar for dollar, for improper profits made by Calugar, SBI, and DCIP. These practices were undisclosed in the prospectuses of the Funds, which falsely represented that the Funds actively police against timing and that premature redemptions will be assessed a charge.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and misleading statements inflating reported revenue from the Company's energy business segment. After the close of the market on February 22, 2008, the Company announced that it would be filing a restatement of its first, second and third quarter 2007 financial statements to correct errors in MBC's revenue recognition practices in the energy business segment. The Company's February 22, 2008 disclosure revealed, inter alia, that the amount of the restatement might exceed the total earnings reported for the energy business segment for the first nine months of the 2007 fiscal year -- the business segment that accounted for almost 70 percent of the Company's total earnings for that period. Furthermore, the February 22, 2008 announcement disclosed that the Company was still evaluating whether it would need to restate earnings for fiscal year 2006 financial statements. Following the issuance of the Company's February 22, 2008 press release, the price of the Company's common stock dropped from a closing price of $36.10 on February 22, 2008 to a closing price of $27.57 at the end of the next trading day. On May 12, 2008, several motions on the appointment of lead plaintiffs, lead counsels and co-lead counsels as well as to consolidate cases were filed by certain individuals and groups.  On June 6, 2008, the Court entered the Order consolidating several actions under In re Michael Baker Corp. Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 08-370.  On June 26, 2008, the Court entered the Order appointing Michael Baker Institutional Investors Group as the presumptive lead plaintiff. According to the Order, Michael Baker Institutional Investors Group consists of the Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority (??SEPTA??) and the City of Tallahassee Retirement System.  On October 14, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint was filed. On December 15, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.   On April 3, 2009, the lead plaintiffs filed an Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement, Preliminary Certification of the Class and Approval of Notice to the Class.  According to the Stipulation of Settlement filed with the motion, the proposed settlement is in the amount of $4,500,000 in cash.

(Nasdaq: BLUD), a global leader in providing automated instrument-reagent systems to the blood transfusion industry, reported it has entered into an agreement to settle the previously reported class action lawsuits against the company and certain of its current and former directors and officers consolidated as In re Immucor, Inc. Securities Litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the ""Court""). The lawsuit alleges that Immucor stock prices were inflated during part of 2004 and 2005 as a result of material misrepresentations or omissions in the company's financial statements and other public announcements. The company continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing and has vigorously defended the lawsuits. Under the settlement agreement, the company's insurance carrier has agreed to pay $2.5 million to the plaintiff class in consideration of an absolute and unconditional release of all claims against the company and the individual defendants. The only costs to the company are legal expenses, which have been expensed as incurred. The Court has given its preliminary approval to the terms of the settlement. The settlement is contingent upon various conditions, including but not limited to final approval by the Court after notice to the class and a hearing scheduled for September 20, 2007. It is not certain the settlement will receive final approval from the Court nor be upheld if challenged on appeal. As summarized by the Company??s FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2006, between August 31 and October 19, 2005, a series of ten class-action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers alleging violatio"" of the securities laws. The Court has consolidated these cases for disposition under the caption In re Immucor, Inc. Securities Litigation, File No. 1:05-CV-2276-WSD, designated lead plaintiffs, permitted the filing of an amended consolidated complaint, and established a schedule for briefing the Company??s motion to dismiss the claims. The consolidated complaint, brought on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased Immucor stock between August 16, 2004 and August 29, 2005, alleges that the Company??s stock prices during that period were inflated as a result of material misrepresentations or omissions in the Company??s financial statements and other public announcements regarding its business. On March 7, 2006, the Company timely moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On October 4, 2006, the Court denied the Company??s motion to dismiss.  The original Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""ange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. During the Class Period, the complaint claims that Defendants misrepresented that Immucor's financial statements and disclosures fairly and accurately reflected the Company's results of operations as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") and the Exchange Act. The Complaint also charges that Defendants' Sarbanes-Oxley certifications during the Class Period were also false and misleading, as the Company, knowingly or with severe recklessness, lacked adequate internal controls and failed to keep proper books and records in violation of their well publicized Code of Corporate Conduct.  The nature of Defendants' fraud began to come to light on August 26, 2005 when the Company was forced to announce that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") had launched a formal investigation into payments made by its Italian unit and its president, Defendant De Chirico, in October 2003 to a physician connected with a hospital with which the Company was doing business. After the market closed on August 29, 2005, the Company revealed further that its Chief Financial Officer had resigned, that it would be revising its previously issued results for at least two quarters in order to account for a previously unrecorded accrued bonus, and that its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2005 would be further delayed due to additional accounting and auditing procedures the Company claimed was necessary to properly reflect the accrued bonus and to render the internal controls report required by Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit last Friday upheld the ruling of the New Jersey district court, which approved the firm's fee application after concluding that Labaton Sacharow had earned every penny that they've sought in resolving the securities class action. Shareholder Rita Carfagna had appealed after U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Chesler shrugged off her criticism and said the firm was skilled and efficient, and its bill on the low end of legal fee applications in similar cases. The spat stems from a $185 million settlement of a number of class actions consolidated in July 2000 in which shareholders claimed that Bristol-Myers and its top executives misled them about the safety and predicted sales of a new pill. According to the docket posted, on May 11, 2006, the Settlement Fairness Hearing was held before U.S. District Judge Stanley R. Chesler.  That day, the Court entered the Order granting the motion for attorney fees as well as the Judgment granting the motion for settlement.  In a press release dated February 9, 2006, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company announced today that U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler has entered preliminary approval of a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the consolidated securities class action litigation, pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, relating to the Bristol-Myers Squibb investigational compound, omapatrilat (VANLEV(TM)). The settlement was entered into without any admission of wrongdoing by the Company. Notice to potentially eligible claimants will be mailed out in early March 2006. The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including the District Court's review and final approval at a fairness hearing, which is scheduled for May 11, 2006. In a press release dated January 23, 2006, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company has recorded a reserve in the amount of $185 million in anticipation of the potential settlement of its consolidated securities class action litigation, pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, relating to the company's investigational compound, omapatrilat (VANLEV(TM)). Beginning in the spring of 2000, the plaintiffs brought lawsuits against the company and certain company executives alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. The parties have reached an agreement in principle on financial terms and are seeking to finalize non-financial aspects of a potential settlement. At this time, there can be no assurance that a final settlement agreement will be reached. Further, any settlement would be subject to a number of conditions, including preliminary court approval, completion of a fairness hearing and final court approval following completion of the fairness hearing. There can be no assurance that those conditions will be satisfied. In a press release dated August 19, 2005, a federal judge in Trenton has denied a bid by Bristol-Myers Squibb to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit, clearing the way for a jury trial as soon as this winter.  U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler issued a series of rulings late Tuesday that significantly narrow the scope of the shareholders' case, which alleges Bristol officials hyped Vanlev, even though they knew the Food and Drug Administration would reject it - all in an effort to boost the company's stock price. In a 109-page ruling, Chesler removed Brist""l's chief executive, as a defendant in the case, and limited the liability of former Chairman and Chief Executive. The judge also excluded six of 11 public statements by Bristol about Vanlev the lawsuit claimed were misleading. The judge also dismissed all claims related to the period from March 2001 to March 2002, when Bristol was conducting a massive clinical trial on Vanlev. Most significantly, Chesler dismissed allegations Bristol executives personally profited from the inflated stock price. Most shareholder lawsuits allege ""pump and dump"" deals in which executives profit from cashing stock options. In this case, Chesler ruled, ""the plaintiff will have to rely on conscious misbehavior or recklessness"" to establish motive. In 2002, a class action was filed against Bristol Myers Squibb Company in the US District Court for the Southern Distict of New York.  According to the docket 02-CV-2251 for the 2002 action, on October 7, 2002, the Court issued a Stipulation and Order granting the motion to transfer claims and the complaints containing only Vanlev claims to the USDC for the District of New Jersey.   All non-Vanlev cases and all non-Vanlev claims pending in the USDC for Southern District of New York were ordered to remain in that Court. The original lawsuit alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued false and misleading statements relating to the development of the drug, VANLEV, and promoted VANLEV as the most effective drug for treating hypertension.

As alleged in the Complaint, on March 22, 2006, BMY announced that it, along with Sanofi-Aventis SA, entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex, Inc. (Apotex) to resolve a patent infringement lawsuit (Apotex Settlement) related to the drug Plavix. The Complaint further alleges that throughout the Class Period, BMY failed to disclose material facts regarding the Apotex Settlement including (1) that BMY had relinquished material rights in connection with the settlement, including the right to treble damages (2) that if the Apotex Settlement was not approved, Apotex could flood the market with its generic version of Plavix and (3) that BMY had negotiated improper side agreements in connection with the Apotex Settlement. On July 27, 2006, BMY revealed that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) was conducting a criminal investigation into the Apotex Settlement and, as alleged, as a result of this disclosure, the price of BMY's securities declined $1.95 per share, or 7.5%, to close at $24.04 per share. On August 8, 2006, BMY disclosed additional material facts regarding the Apotex Settlement. As a result of this disclosure, it is alleged that BMY's securities declined $1.56 per share, or approximately 7%, to close at $21.21 per share. The Complaint also alleges that on May 10, 2007 BMY issued a press release disclosing that the Company agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of making false statements to a government agency in connection with the Apotex Settlement. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q For The Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2007, in June and July 2007, two putative class action complaints, Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Assoc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., et al., 07 CV 5867 and Jean Lai v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., were filed in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York against the Company, the Companys former CEO and current Chief Financial Officer. The complaints allege violations of securities laws for allegedly failing to disclose material information relating to efforts to settle the PLAVIX* patent infringement litigation with Apotex. On September 20, 2007, the Court dismissed the Lai case without prejudice, changed the caption of the case to In re Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co. Securities Litigation, and appointed Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board as lead plaintiff. On October 15, 2007, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board filed an amended complaint making similar allegations as the earlier filed complaints, but no longer naming the Companys Chief Financial Officer as a defendant. In November 2007, the defendants filed various motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint.  These motions are currently pending before the Court. In a press release dated August 21, 2008, Judge Paul A. Crotty in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York handed down the order Tuesday, denying BMS and the two former executives motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed jointly by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board and the Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association. &  The Court finds that the plaintiffs have pleaded their claims with sufficient particularity to survive the threshold pleading standard of a motion to dismiss, and that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Bristol-Myers silence with regard to the details of the Apotex settlement made its public statements misleading or false, Crotty wrote. According to an article dated June 16, 2009, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. has reached the outline of a settlement in a securities class action that accuses the drugmaker of duping shareholders and causing a stock drop when it failed to properly disclose a patent deal for a generic version of its blood-thinning drug Plavix.

Brocade designs, develops, markets, sells and supports data storage networking products and services. Specifically, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading financial statements to the investing public. On May 16, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing the restatement of its fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2004 earnings. The release stated that ""the Company will restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ending 2002 through 2004 to record additional charges for stock-based compensation expense."" The release noted that the Company estimated the impact of the restatement would be to reduce fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 earnings per share by up to $0.11 and $0.19, respectively. The Company also estimated that fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 earnings per share would be reduced as well. As a result of this announcement, Brocade's stock dropped to $4.13 per share, compared to the $40+ per share prices it traded at during the Class Period. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 26, 2008,  beginning on or about May 19, 2005, several securities class action complaints were filed against Brocade and certain of its then current and former officers. These actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of purchasers of Brocades stock from February 21, 2001 to May 15, 2005. These lawsuits followed and relate to Brocades restatement of certain financial results due to stock-based compensation accounting issues. On January 12, 2006, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On April 14, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of purchasers of Brocades stock from May 18, 2000 to May 15, 2005. On November 3, 2006, the Court denied Brocades motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and granted certain individual defendants motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint with leave to amend. On January 2, 2007, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on behalf of purchasers of Brocades stock from May 18, 2000 to May 15, 2005. The amended consolidated complaint names the Company and certain of its former officers and directors and alleges, among other things, violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The amended consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that Brocade and the individual defendants made false or misleading public statements regarding Brocades business and operations and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief against the defendants. On January 29, 2007, Brocade filed its answer to the amended consolidated complaint. On August 7, 2007, a federal jury convicted Brocades former Chief Executive Officer, Gregory Reyes, on ten criminal counts related to the Companys historical stock option practices. On August 27, 2007, the Court denied certain individual defendants motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. On October 12, 2007 the Court granted lead plaintiffs motion for class certification and certified a class in this action consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of Brocade between May 18, 2000 to May 15, 2005, inclusive, and who were damaged thereby. The Court also partially granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment against Mr. Reyes, who is a defendant in this action, prohibiting him from re-litigating in this class action the jurys finding from Mr. Reyes criminal case that he knowingly and willfully made material misrepresentations in Brocades Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2001, 2002 and 2003. On December 5, 2007, a federal jury convicted Brocades former human resources director, Stephanie Jensen, on two criminal counts related to the Companys historical stock option practices. (Ms. Jensen is not a defendant in the class action.)  On May 30, 2008, Brocade reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiffs to settle the federal securities class action that would result in a payment by Brocade of $160.0 million to the plaintiff class in exchange for the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the litigation.

Prior to any news of options backdating reaching in the market, shares of Broadcom traded at slightly above $40.00 per share and, thereafter, shares traded down to approximately $27.50 per share -- a rapid decline of over 31%. On November 29, 2006 the judge entered an order stating that the lead plaintiff ""shall file a consolidated class-action complaint within 60 days of Broadcoms filing of the Restatement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.""  The lead plaintiffs filed a motion for an extension of time to file the consolidated complaint, which the judge denied on March 15, 2007.  The plaintiffs appealed the ruling and the US Court of Appeals granted their motion to stay the March order. The lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint on April 21, 2008.  Defendants responded with motions to dismiss the complaint on June 20, 2008.  The judge ruled in favor of the defendants on October 6, 2008, but provided plaintiffs twenty days to amend and re-file.

According to a press release dated December 29, 2009, fabless semiconductor vendor Broadcom Corp. has agreed in principle to settle for $160.5 million in cash a securities class action litigation pending against the company and some of its current and former officers and directors, the company said Tuesday (Dec. 29).  Under the proposed settlement, the claims against Broadcom and its officers and directors will be dismissed with prejudice, Broadcom (Irvine, Calif.) said. The company said it expects to record the settlement amount as a one-time charge in its fourth quarter financial statement.  The proposed settlement remains subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including negotiation and execution of a final stipulation of settlement, and approval by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Broadcom said. ... Earlier this month, a U.S. District Court judge dismissed related securities fraud charges against Broadcom co-founder Henry Nicholas and William Ruehle, the company's former chief financial officer, citing prosecutor misconduct. The same judge earlier dismissed a guilty plea entered by Broadcom co-founder Henry Samueli on charges that he lied to investigators in connection with the stock options backdating probe. On April 30, 2010, the lead plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of proposed Class Action settlement with Broadcom defendants, which was approved on June 1, 2010.  The Settlement Hearing will be held on August 2, 2010, to determine, among other things, whether the proposed Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and should be approved by the Court. According to a press release dated June 11, 2010, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and an Order of the Court, that the above-captioned action has been certified as a class action for the purposes of settlement only and that a settlement of certain claims for $160,500,000 has been proposed by the Settling Parties. Claims against defendant Ernst & Young LLP are not part of the Settlement and continue to be litigated on appeal. A hearing will be held before the Honorable Manuel L. Real of the United States District Court for the Central District of California in the Spring Street Courthouse, Room 8, 312 N. Spring Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012, at 10:00 a.m., on August 2, 2010 to determine: whether the proposed settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate whether the Settlement Class should be certified and a class representative and class counsel be appointed whether the proposed plan of allocation for distribution of the settlement proceeds should be approved to consider the request of Lead Counsel for attorneys fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses and to consider the request of Lead Plaintiff, if any, for reimbursement of its reasonable costs and expenses relating to its representations of the Settlement Class. The Court may change the date of the hearing without providing another notice. On August 2, 2010, the hearing was held before Judge Manuel L. Real.  According to the Court Minutes, there are no objectors to the settlement present.  The Court grants both the motion for final approval of the proposed class action settlement with Broadcom defendants and the motion for attorney's fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses.

(Nasdaq:BRKS) announced that it has reached a settlement in principle regarding the consolidated securities class action filed in June 2006 pertaining to the Company's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting. The terms of the settlement, which include no admission of liability or wrong doing by Brooks, provide for a full and complete release of all claims in the litigation and a payment of $7.75 million to be paid into a settlement fund, pending final documentation and approval by the Court of a plan of distribution. There will be no earnings or cash effect of this settlement as the $7.75 million will be paid by the Company's liability insurers. Once approved, the settlement will provide a full release of Brooks and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations raised in the class action, and it will resolve all class action litigation pending against the Company and against present and former officers and directors of the Company. In a press release dated November 8, 2007, taking into account investigations recently launched by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice into semiconductor maker Brooks Automation Inc., a district court judge refused to throw out a class action options backdating suit filed against the company. In a decision handed down on Nov. 6, Judge Rya W. Zobel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts kept alive the options backdating allegations levied against Brooks, despite tossing a handful claims made against individuals and approving a motion to dismiss filed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Related cases were ordered consolidated and lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Complaint on February 12, 2007.  Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on April 9, 2007. The original complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants Brooks Automation, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 by publicly issuing a series of false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and financial results, thus causing Brooks's shares to trade at artificially inflated prices. In particular, the Complaint alleges that on March 18, 2006, The Wall Street Journal published a story titled ""The Perfect Payday - Some CEOs reap millions by landing stock options when they are most valuable Luck - or something else?"" that identified Brooks as one of several companies ""with wildly improbable option-grant patterns."" On April 26, 2006, Brooks disclosed that its Board of Directors created a special committee to conduct an internal review of matters related to past stock option grants, including the timing of such grants and associated documentation. The Complaint further alleges that on May 11, 2006, Brooks issued a press release titled ""Brooks Automation to Restate Past Periods Related to Certain Stock Option Grants,"" that stated, in part, that ""the Company will be required to correct certain SEC filings, including particularly its financial statements contained in filings for some or all of the periods commencing in fiscal 1999 and ending in fiscal 2005."" Brooks further stated that ""[t]he Company believes that it accounted for certain matters concerning stock options incorrectly, and as a result recognized less compensation expense than it should have in periods prior to fiscal 2006."" On May 18, 2006, two individuals reportedly resigned from the Company's Board of Directors. The Complaint also alleges that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry concerning stock option grant practices to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred and Brooks has allegedly received a grand jury document subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York requesting records pertaining to the granting of stock options. The Complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, certain Company insiders sold approximately 320,000 Brooks shares at artificially inflates prices for proceeds of approximately $6.4 million. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the Company's recent disclosures, that since March 20, 2006, the first trading day after the above-noted Wall Street Journal article of March 18, 2006, shares of Brooks have declined from $13.88 per share at the opening of trading on March 20, 2006, to close at $12 per share at the close of trading on May 23, 2006, a decline of $1.88 per share, or approximately 14%.",ACCOUNTING (OPTION DATING),1,0,0,0,0

In addition, the discontinuance of the iAdvance program may result in elevated rates of nonpayment on outstanding iAdvance loans."" Following the publication of this report, the next trading day, shares of the Company dropped precipitously -- falling over $13.00 per share, to below $20.00 per share -- a decline of over 40%.  The plaintiff in the first filed class action voluntarily dismissed his action.  The case is continuing in a second filed action, Alaa M. Elgaouni v. Meta Financial Group, Inc., J. Tyler Haahr, David W. Leedom, Case No. C10-4108MWB. On January 12, 2011, Judge Mark W. Bennett granted the motion to appoint The Eden Partnership as lead plaintiff and approved The Eden Partnership's selection of Kahn Swick & Foti LLC as lead counsel.  The lead plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 14, 2011, and the defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss.  The motion was denied on July 18, 2011.

Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the plaintiff class will receive a payment of $10,500,000 less approved attorneys fees and expenses, which has been funded to an escrow account by the Companys insurance carrier. As summarized by the same SEC filing, since the initial lawsuit, other suits containing substantially similar allegations and with similar, but not exactly the same, class periods were filed. On July 5, 2006, a single Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed in the Welmon action in the Southern District of New York consolidating all previously filed actions. The company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which was denied by the Court. On March 2, 2007, the lead plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and the Company and the individual defendants filed an opposition to class certification on April 2, 2007. After an initial hearing on the motion for class certification held on May 29, 2007, the Court scheduled another hearing to be held on November 13-14, 2007, to resolve factual issues regarding the typicality and adequacy of the proposed class representatives. The parties agreed to a rescheduling of the hearing to a later date. On January 22, 2008, the parties entered into a de""initive settlement agreement that, without any admission of liability, would fully resolve the claims made against the Company and the individual defendants in this litigation. The original Complaint alleges that defendants Chicago Bridge and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false statement. Specifically defendants failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (i) that the Company was materially overstating its financial results by failing to properly utilize percentage-of-completion accounting and (ii) that the Company was not following its publicly stated revenue recognition policies. The complaint alleges that on or around October 26, 2005, Chicago Bridge announced that it would be delaying the release of its third quarter financial results because they were not finalized as scheduled.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that on January 23, 2003, the Company shocked investors when it announced that it had overstated its net income by $5 million due to improper accounting from 1997 to 2001, inclusive, and that it would restate its financial results for the five-year period. Moreover, throughout the Class Period, defendants failed to disclose that the SEC had commenced an informal investigation into the Company's improper accounting. Additionally, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued false and misleading statements, including profit warnings, that failed to disclose the loss of a major contract between Cambrex and Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (""TKT"") to manufacture the drug Replagal(TM) to treat Fabry disease, and the effect of the loss on the Company's financial prospects. Further, the complaint alleges that as early as October 2002, defendants knew that it was  more likely than not that the Company would lose the TKT contract as a result  of FDA concerns with TKT's Replagal application, and that Cambrex would not be  able to adequately and efficiently replace the business resulting from this  likely loss. On January 14, 2003, defendants are alleged to have known that the  loss of the contract was certain when TKT announced the FDA's rejection of the  Replagal application. It was not until April 3, 2003, nearly three months  later, that defendant revised downwards Cambrex's earnings and revenues  guidance to account for the loss of the TKT contract, precipitating a 37  percent drop in the price of Cambrex stock. Defendants never disclosed the TKT  contract and the effect of its cancellation on its financial prospects. The   ""mystery contract"" only became public knowledge on April 28, 2003 when it was  disclosed by a trade publication. On July 25, 2003, the last day of the Class  Period, defendants conceded during a conference call that they in fact knew  about the loss of the TKT contract when they issued their profit warnings. On  that same day, the market reacted swiftly and dramatically to this news,  causing the price of Cambrex common stock to drop $5.09 or 20 percent from its  previous day's close. As summarized by the Company??s Form 10-K For The Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007, five class action suits were filed with the New Jersey Federal District Court (the ""ourt""). In January 2004, the Court consolidated the cases, designated the lead plaintiff and selected counsel to represent the class. An amended complaint was filed in March 2004. The lawsuit has been brought as a class action in the names of purchasers of the Company's common stock from October 21, 1998 through July 25, 2003. The complaint alleges that the Company failed to disclose in a timely fashion the January 2003 accounting restatement and subsequent SEC investigation, as well as the loss of a significant contract at the Baltimore facility. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss in May 2004. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a reply brief and in October 2005, the Court denied the Company's Motion to Dismiss. The Company continues to believe that the complaints are without merit and will vigorously defend against them. As such, the Company has recorded no reserves related to this matter. The Company has reached its deductible under its insurance policy and further costs, expenses and any settlement are expected to be paid by the Company's insurers. The Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the settlement of all claims in this matter. The settlement includes a payment to class members of an amount which is well within the policy limits of, and is expected to be paid by, the Company's insurance. As a result, it is not expected to impact the Company's operating results. Cambrex continues to deny liability in the matter. The settlement is subject to final approval by the Court and entry of an agreed upon Final Judgment. Class members will have the opportunity to either object to the terms of the settlement or to opt out of the class. On May 6, 2008, District Court Judge Peter G. Sheridan signed the Final Judgment and Order.  According to the Order, the settlement in the amount of $3,150,000 in cash was approved and the complaint dismissed with prejudice.ee",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

In particular, defendants caused the Company to issue false and misleading statements in its public filings, press releases, and conference calls that touted the Company's positive financial results, significant growth, and presented aggressive forward guidance.  Specifically, defendants trumpeted the Company's ""ransformation"" of its business operations and implementation of new strategic initiatives that would improve its financial performance. When questioned about the impact of the Company's wholesale transition on its financial results, defendants steadfastly rebuffed notions that the transition would adversely affect its financial performance going forward or its ability to achieve its business outlook. Further, the complaint alleges the defendants continued to maintain that the Company had an effective system of internal and disclosure controls in place concerning its financial reporting. 3. The complaint further states that the Company was facing significant charges arising from legacy contracts entered into in or before 2009, and substantial weakness in sales in its North American sector. Moreover, plaintiffs claim that defendants knew that the Company ""lack[ed] operational discipline, process and controls"" and that such ""operational issues"" would result in charges arising from certain fixed-price projects that possessed cost assumption for contingencies that rendered such contracts unprofitable and at a high-risk of loss. The Company??s Chief Executive Officer acknowledged that despite his earlier aggressive statements, the ""hortfall in North American sales and revenue production ?? [was] not completely unforeseen."" As a result of defendants' materially false and misleading statements, states the complaint, the Company??s stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, reaching a high of $6.86 per share on April 6, 2011. On August 3, 2011, the Company issued a press release and held an earnings conference call reporting financial results that were ""ignificantly below ?? expectations,""and announcing that it would suspend its full-year 2011 guidance due to ""sales weakness in North America, [and] changes in estimates on five [fixed-price] projects that were signed in 2009 or earlier, and required adjustments to the balance sheet."" The underperforming five fixed-price contracts resulted in $13.4 million in charges against the Company's quarterly revenue and earnings. Further, the Company disclosed a disappointing 23% decline in revenue for its North American operations. When the Company revealed the truth about its business health, the Company??s stock price fell to $1.22 or approximately 23.6% in a single day, closing at just $3.94 per share on August 3, 2011 on extraordinarily high-volume trading. According to the Minute Entry filed on January 31, 2012, the Court appointed lead plaintiff and approved the selection of lead counsel. On April 9, 2012, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On June 7, 2012, plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint. On November 26, 2013, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Settlement.

In response to this surprise announcement, the price of the companys common stock dropped approximately 15%.  Merely a week later, on October 22, 2008, defendants stunned investors by acknowledging that the Company was reviewing the recognition of revenue related to customer contracts signed in the first quarter of 2008 and that it expected to restate its financial statements not only for that quarter, but also the first half of 2008.  As a result of these disclosures, the companys stock price dropped another 25%, as the artificial inflation caused by defendants' false and misleading statements came out of the stock price. On March 4, 2009, Judge Samuel Conti granted the plaintiffs motion to consolidate three related actions and further granted the motion to appoint the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiffs selection of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as lead counsel.  On April 25, 2009, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Complaint.  On June 8, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint.

The complaint alleges that career education publicly touted its business and financial performance, the performance of its stock price and its industry leading position as reasons for why investors should purchase its stock. These, and other statements particularized in the complaint, were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose that CEC had been regularly falsifying student records in order to increase graduation rates and enrollment, conceal problems that could have threatened the accreditation of its schools, and generally, to allow it to increase its profitability. On December 3, 2003, the market learned that the former registrar of CECs Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, California alleged, in a complaint filed with an accreditation agency, that the school falsified student records to ensure that the school passed inspections by accreditation auditors and to increase enrollment.

On March 23, 2004, the Court entered the Order granting the motion to appoint lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and granting in part and denying in part the motion for consolidation.  On May 24, 2004, a Consolidated Complaint was filed, and on June 17, 2004, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint.

On May 24, 2005, the plaintiffs further filed a Third Amended Consolidated Complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Third Amended Consolidated Complaint. The original complaint charges Cerus and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants artificially inflated the price of Cerus stock by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements about the company's development programme for the Intercept Blood System for Red Blood Cells (Intercept RBC), a system that applies Helinx technology for the treatment of red blood cell concentrates.  The complaint further alleges that Cerus claimed that its Helinx technology for the treatment of RBC concentrates was represented by a family of novel small molecules that could target and crosslink nucleic acids of pathogens. The complaint alleges that Cerus claimed that when S-303, one of the novel Helinx compounds, was added to blood or blood components, it would cross through cell walls or viral membranes, and then bind to and crosslink these foreign nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). Cerus claimed that this action prevented the replication of the undesired viruses, bacteria and other pathogens, cutting off their capacity to cause infection. Cerus claimed that since red blood cells do not contain nuclear DNA or RNA, S-303 and other Helinx compounds could be safely added to RBC concentrates. Cerus also stated that its Helinx technology represented a selective and targeted approach to the inactivation of the undesired viruses, bacteria and other pathogens and a way to assure the safety of the blood supply. As a result of the defendants' false statements, Cerus stock traded at inflated prices during the Class Period, causing millions of dollars of damages to the Class. On 17 May 2001, just as Cerus stock had inflated to a price of $59/share, the company sold $78 M of its own securities via a secondary offering.

In Stoneridge Investment Partners LLC vs. Scientific-Atlanta Inc. et al., Stoneridge sued after shares of Charter Communications Inc. fell once the cable operator admitted that it had fraudulently manipulated its quarterly reports by altering its business arrangements with Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola. The Supreme Court's majority opinion said Scientific-Atlanta's ""deceptive acts were not communicated to the public."" Therefore, the petitioner ""cannot show reliance upon any of respondents' actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability,"" according to the opinion, which was written by Anthony Kennedy and joined by John Roberts Jr., Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr. The decision from the high court is the latest in a string of disappointments for investors, as justices decided 5-to-3 that shareholders can not necessarily sue third parties that help companies deceive investors.  According to a press release dated May 31, 2006, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a district court's dismissal of a securities fraud class action as to claims against third-party vendors not alleged to have made material misrepresentations or omissions to the shareholders of a company. The Eighth Circuit ruled that the third-party vendors could at most be liable for aiding and abetting, which does not give rise to a securities fraud claim. Stoneridge Investment Partners, on behalf of investors who purchased Charter Communications Inc. stock, sued Charter for securities fraud, alleging Charter participated in a fraudulent scheme to falsely inflate its financial health by delaying the disconnection of customers who were no longer paying their bills and entering into sham transactions with equipment vendors. Stoneridge named the vendors, Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and Motorola Inc (the vendors), alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ?10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Specifically, Stoneridge claimed that Charter, a provider of cable services, engaged in sham transactions where Charter paid an additional $20 per vendor-provided set-top boxes to the vendors, and the vendors agreed to pay Charter additional payments in the form of advertising fees. &The Eighth Circuit ruled that the claims against the vendors were aiding and abetting claims that are not covered by ?10(b) and Rule 10b-5. According to the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, on June 30, 2005, the Court issued its final approval of the settlements. At the end of September 2005, after the period for appeals of the settlements expired, Stipulations of Dismissal were filed with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals resulting in the dismissal of the two appeals with prejudice. Procedurally therefore, the settlements are final. As amended, the Stipulations of Settlement provided that, in exchange for a release of all claims by plaintiffs against Charter and its former and present officers and directors named in the Actions, Charter would pay to the plaintiffs a combination of cash and equity collectively valued at $144 million, which was to include the fees and expenses of plaintiffs counsel. Of this amount, $64 million was to be paid in cash (by Charters insurance carriers) and the $80 million balance was to be paid in shares of Charter Class A common stock having an aggregate value of $40 million and ten-year warrants to purchase shares of Charter Class A common stock having an aggregate warrant value of $40 million, with such values in each case being determined pursuant to formulas set forth in the Stipulations of Settlement. However, Charter had the right, in its sole discretion, to substitute cash for some or all of the aforementioned securities on a dollar for dollar basis. Pursuant to that right, Charter elected to fund the $80 million obligation with 13.4 million shares of Charter Class A common stock (having an aggregate value of approximately $15 million pursuant to the formula set forth in the Stipulations of Settlement) with the remaining balance (less an agreed upon $2 million discount in respect of that portion allocable to plaintiffs attorneys fees) to be paid in cash. In addition, Charter had agreed to issue additional shares of its Class A common stock to its insurance carrier having an aggregate value of $5 million however, by agreement with its carrier, Charter paid $4.5 million in cash in lieu of issuing such shares. As a result in 2004, the Company recorded a $149 million litigation liability within other long-term liabilities and a $64 million insurance receivable as part of other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheet and an $85 million special charge on its consolidated statement of operations.

On March 12, 2003, the Panel transferred the six Federal Class Actions not filed in the Eastern District of Missouri to that district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the eight Federal Class Actions already pending there. The Panels transfer order assigned the Federal Class Actions to Judge Charles A. Shaw. By virtue of a prior court order, StoneRidge Investment Partners LLC became lead plaintiff upon entry of the Panel??s transfer order. StoneRidge subsequently filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint.

In a press release dated July 18, 2007, a federal judge has granted final approval of a $93 million settlement in a securities fraud suit against CIGNA Corp. that accused the company of hiding the fact that it was experiencing significant problems in an overhaul of its computer systems and that its stock price had plummeted by 45 percent when news of the problems was disclosed. In his 12-page opinion in In re CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation, U.S. District Judge Michael M. Baylson of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also approved a $6 million settlement in a related derivative and awarded more than $23.5 million in attorney fees and costs to the plaintiffs lawyers. In the class action suit, Baylson awarded more than $21.3 million in attorney fees to the plaintiffs' team, led by attorney Sherrie R. Savett of Berger & Montague, who represented the lead plaintiff, the Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System (SERS). Baylson also awarded $720,000 in attorney fees to the plaintiffs lawyers in the derivative suit -- Robert I. Harwood and Daniella Quitt of Harwood Feffer in New York and Jacob A. Goldberg of Faruqi & Faruqi in Elkins Park, Pa. The fees were justified, Baylson found, because ""the amount of the settlement in this case is significant and represents one of the largest securities settlements in this district."" In a press release dated February 14, 2007, YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and an Order of the above Court dated January 24, 2007, that a hearing will be held on April 27, 2007 at 9:30 a.m. in Courtroom 3A, U.S. Courthouse, 601 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106, to determine whether the proposed settlement of the above-captioned action (""Action"") for $93,000,000 in cash (the ""Settlement"") should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable and adequate, and in the best interests of the Class whether to direct the parties to consummate the Settlement in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (""Stipulation"") and to dismiss with prejudice the Action and the claims of the Class Members and whether to award Plaintiffs' Co-Lead Counsel attorneys' fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses whether to award reimbursement of costs and expenses for representation of the Class and whether the Plan of Allocation should be approved by the Court. Unless otherwise noted, defined terms in this Summary Notice of Pendency and Settlement of Class Action have the same meaning as those terms are defined in the Stipulation and the Notice of Pendency and Settlement of Class Action (""Notice""). In a press release dated December 8, 2006, CIGNA announced today that it has reached an agreement to resolve claims filed in federal court against the company and certain of its officers in 2002 on behalf of a class of CIGNA shareholders. The settlement, which specifies $93 million to be paid to the plaintiffs and their attorneys, is subject to a definitive written agreement by the parties and approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The settlement is also dependent upon a certain level of class participation.  A fairness hearing before the Court is expected to be held in April 2007 with final approval expected shortly thereafter. On March 20, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Second Revised Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint.  On April 6, 2006, the defendant Cigna filed a motion for summary judgment which was later denied in the Order entered on August 21, 2006.  On August 31, 2006, Cigna filed another motion for summary judgment which is currently pending before the court.  On May 30, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class.  The motion was granted on August 21, 2006. According to the Companys FORM 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, in late 2002, several purported class action lawsuits were filed against CIGNA and certain of its officers by individuals seeking to represent a class of purchasers of CIGNA securities from May 2, 2001 to October 24, 2002. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading CIGNA shareholders with respect to the companys performance during the class period. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and attorneys fees. In 2003, these suits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation. CIGNAs motions to dismiss certain claims were granted in 2004 and 2005. In January 2006, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint to conform to Court Orders dismissing claims related to certain issues and statements.   The original complaint charges Cigna, its Chief Executive Officer, its President and Chairman of the Board, its Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, and it"" Chief Accounting Officer with violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market during the Class Period. As alleged in the Complaint, throughout the Class Period, defendants  issued press releases announcing CIGNA's quarterly and annual results of  operations and filed reports with the SEC, which reported its financial  performance and seemingly impressive earnings growth and represented  that operating income in 2002 was expected to be $1.1 billion. CIGNA's representations issued during the Class Period were materially  false and misleading when made because they failed to disclose that  CIGNA had failed to adequately reserve (by at least hundreds of millions  of dollars) for its obligations under the Guaranteed Minimum Death  Benefits (""GMDB"") reinsurance that it had provided, thereby artificially  inflating its earnings and net worth and its projected income figure was  lacking in any reasonable basis when made. On September 3, 2002, after the market closed CIGNA issued a press  release announcing that it has instituted a program ""to manage run-off  reinsurance exposure"" for its GMDB obligations, requiring it to take a  $720 million after-tax ($1.1 billion pre-tax) charge. In reaction to  the announcement, the price of CIGNA common stock dropped by 10% during the day, closing at $82.65 on September 3, 2002, down from an August 30, 2002 (the previous trading day) close of $85.12 per share. On September 4, 2002, Standard & Poors Rating Services issued a press  release announcing that it had place CIGNA's A+ counterparty credit  rating and CIGNA's financial strength ratings on CreditWatch with  negative implication.

CIT is a leading commercial and consumer finance company, providing clients with financing and leasing products and advisory services in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements about the Company's financial condition. Specifically, CIT's public financial statements failed to account for tens of millions of dollars in loans to Silver State Helicopter (""Silver State""), which were highly unlikely to be repaid and should have been written off. On March 6, 2008, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods issued an analyst report on CIT lowering its first quarter 2008 earnings per share estimate by $.08 based on concerns that CIT would have to write down a significant portion of its private student loan portfolio, including the risk that the Company would have to charge off $179 million of private student loans made to students of Silver State, which recently filed for bankruptcy. As a result, CIT's stock price dropped $4.50 to close to $15.86 on March 6, 2008. On May 26, 2009, the Court entered the Order signed by Judge Barbara S. Jones consolidating three related actions and approving Pensioenfonds Horeca & Catering (PH&C) as lead plaintiff and approving PH&C's selection of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as lead counsel.  On July 16, 2009, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Complaint adding certain officers as defendants and adding claims from The Securities Act of 1933.  On September 11, 2009, the defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On November 9, 2009, defendant CIT Group Inc. filed a suggestion of bankruptcy, and on November 16, 2009, the lead plaintiff filed a Notice of Dismissal of Defendant CIT Group Inc.   On June 10, 2010, the Court entered the Opinion and Order signed by Judge Barbara S. Jones denying the defendants?? motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class on November 19, 2010. The plaintiffs filed leave to file an amended motion for class certification, which was granted on September 9, 2011.

Candela engages in the development and commercialization of laser and light-based systems that allow physicians and personal care practitioners to treat various cosmetic and medical conditions worldwide. The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business and financial results. According to the complaint, the true facts, which were known by defendants but concealed from the investing public, were as follows: (i) that the Company was quickly losing market share to competitors as it lacked a competitive multi-configuration/multi-application device and (ii) that the Company had received communications from Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc. (Palomar) regarding the alleged infringement of Palomars patents by Candela, which was material information for investors as Palomar had made it a pattern and practice of suing the cosmetic laser industry for infringement and had successfully forced numerous competitors to license its technology and, at a minimum, the prospect of patent litigation presented increased costs to the Company and (iii) based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company, its earnings and prospects. On August 21, 2006, after the close of the market, Candela issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2006. For the fourth quarter, the Company reported net income of $0.10 per share  far below analysts earnings expectations of $0.23 per share. In response to the announcement, the price of Candela stock declined from $14.49 per share to $10.33 per share on extremely heavy trading volume. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 27, 2008, on April 2 and April 22, 2008, respectively, two substantially similar putative class action lawsuits, entitled Western Pa.

The remaining settlement amount was paid following the September 6, 2007 hearing. On October 5, 2007, two former officers of Consumers filed an appeal of the order approving the settlement of the shareholder litigation. Based on the objections they filed in the District Court and comments made on the record at the fairness hearing on September 6, 2007, they are not challenging the amount of the settlement. Their principal complaint was with the exclusion of all present and former officers and their immediate families from participation in the settlement. It is not anticipated that the appeal will result in changes to any material terms of the settlement approved by the District Court. As summarized by the same SEC filing, Beginning in May 2002, a number of complaints were filed against CMS Energy, Consumers and certain officers and directors of CMS Energy and its affiliates in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The cases were consolidated into a single lawsuit (the Shareholder Action), which generally seeks unspecified damages based on allegations that the defendants violated United States securities laws and regulations by making allegedly false and misleading statements about CMS Energys business and financial condition, particularly with respect to revenues and expenses recorded in connection with round-trip trading by CMS MST. In January 2005, the court granted a motion to dismiss Consumers and three of the individual defendants, but denied the motions to dismiss CMS Energy and the 13 remaining individual defendants. In March 2006, the court conditionally certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased CMS Common Stock during the period of October 25, 2000 through and including May 17, 2002 and who were damaged thereby. The court excluded purchasers of CMS Energys 8.75 percent Adjustable Convertible Trust Securities (ACTS) from the class and, in response, a new class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of ACTS purchasers (the ACTS Action) against the same defendants named in the Shareholder Action.

The disclosure on the last day of the Class Period that the Company would miss certain bond payments caused the price of Conseco stock to drop 11.5%. The Complaint charges that defendants were in possession of materially adverse information about the Company's liquidity problems and manufactured-homes financing business but failed to fully disclose the information to investors, causing Conseco's stock price to become artificially inflated, inflicting damages on investors.

The lawsuit, which was commenced with the filing of several complaints in April and May 2000, is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, and an amended consolidated complaint was filed on August 21, 2001. The consolidated complaint generally alleges that the prospectus used in connection with the offering was inaccurate or misleading because it failed to adequately disclose the alleged opposition of the Human Genome Project and two of its supporters, the governments of the U.S. and the U.K., to providing patent protection to our genomic-based products. Although Celera Genomics has never sought, or intended to seek, a patent on the basic human genome sequence data, the complaint also alleges that we did not adequately disclose the risk that Celera Genomics would not be able to patent this data. The consolidated complaint seeks monetary damages, rescission, costs and expenses, and other relief as the court deems proper. On March 31, 2005, the court certified the case as a class action. The original complaint alleges that the registration statement and prospectus issued in conjunction with the Secondary Offering were materially false and misleading in that they failed to disclose that Celera had engaged in discussions with the Human Genome Project (an international research organization supported by the U.S. and U.K. governments, among others) concerning collaborating ",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The action seeks to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""). Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants issued materially false and misleading statements about their ability to turn the operations of acquired company Oshkosh B'Gosh around. On July 24, 2007, Carter's announced that it was taking a large write-down ($142.9 million) on the tangible assets/goodwill of its Oshkosh subsidiary. The Carters shares reacted negatively to the news, falling from $24.87 to $22.75 per share by the end of trading on July 25, 2007, representing an 8.5% decline in value. On March 13, 2009, Judge J.

On July 17, 2009, the defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On November 18, 2009, a complaint titled Scott Mylroie, et al. v. Carter's, Inc., was filed charging Carter's and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint alleges that Carter's statements and filings during the Class Period were materially false and misleading because they misrepresented or failed to disclose that: (a) the Company had reported certain margin support payments to major wholesale customers in incorrect periods (b) as a result, the Company's financial results were overstated during the Class Period (c) the Company had failed to properly recognize revenue in violation of GAAP (d) the Company lacked adequate internal and financial controls and (e) that, as a result of the above, the Company's financial statements during the Class Period were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On November 24, 2009, the court found it in the interests of judicial economy and conservation of resources to consolidate the two actions filed against the defendants.  The action titled Scott Mylroie, et al. v. Carter's, Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Civil Action No. 1:09-cv-03196-JOF, was consolidated with Plymouth County Retirement System v.

Gilmore of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, the case was settled.  In a press release dated February 10, 2006, Cornell Companies, Inc. announced the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit. In re Cornell Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation was originally filed by certain Cornell stockholders in March 2002 on behalf of all purchasers of Cornell's common stock from March 6, 2001 to March 5, 2002. The Company has agreed to settle this class action lawsuit for $7.0 million to avoid further protracted and expensive litigation. The settlement amount will be funded through the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance and will have no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Under the terms of the settlement, Cornell has not admitted to any wrongdoing. As reported by the Companys FORM 10-Q For the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2005, in March and April 2002, the Company, its former President and Chief Executive Officer, and its former Chief Financial Officer, were named as defendants in four federal putative class action lawsuits.  These four lawsuits were consolidated into the Graydon Williams action and Flyline Partners, LP was appointed lead plaintiff.  As a result, a consolidated complaint was filed by Flyline Partners, LP.  Since then, the court allowed plaintiffs to file an amended consolidated complaint. The amended consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), Rule 10b-5 promulgated under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and/or Section 15 of the Securities Act.  The amended consolidated complaint seeks, among other things, restitution damages, compensatory damages, rescission or a rescissory measure of damages, costs, expenses, attorneys fees and expert fees.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.  In an order entered April 1, 2005, the court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs securities fraud claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The court denied the motion to dismiss as to the remaining claims covering the Companys secondary offering in 2001.  Subject to court approval and documentation, the parties have agreed to settle this matter. The original complaint charges Cornell and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Cornell is a provider of privatized correctional, detention and pre-release services to governmental agencies. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued favorable but false financial statements and made false and misleading statements about the Company's business. As a result of these false statements, the Company's stock traded as high as $18.40. Defendants took advantage of this artificial inflation, selling 3.4 million shares of Cornell stock for proceeds of over $48 million in a November 2001 secondary ",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

As summarized by the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action, dated August 11, 2005, on or about October 4, 2001, the first of five substantially similar putative class action complaints was filed against Defendants. On February 8, 2002, the Court issued an Order consolidating the five cases and appointing movants John C. Hynes, Anton Klaver and Town of Danversthorpe Corpus Fund as Lead Plaintiffs for the putative class. On April 15, 2002, Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (the Complaint). On or about May 24, 2002, Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. On August 29, 2002, after extensive briefing by both sides, Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the Court deny the motion. Thereafter, on October 18, 2002, the Court issued an Order adopting the Report and Recommendation and denying the motion. On December 23, 2002, Defendants answered the Complaint. On December 12, 2002, Plaintiffs moved to certify the proposed class and sub-class and to appoint class representatives. After discovery, extensive briefing and a hearing, Magistrate Judge Mitchell issued a Report and Recommendation on April 14, 2003 recommending that the Court grant Plaintiffs motion to certify the proposed class and sub-class. Thereafter, on May 20, 2003, the Court issued an Order adopting Magistrate Judge Mitchells Report and Recommendation and granting Plaintiffs motion to certify the proposed class and sub-class. On February 18, 2005, after the completion of fact and expert discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs?? claims. Prior to the time Plaintiffs were required to respond to that motion, the parties agreed to the settlement. The original class action complaint filed alleged that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

At the Conference, the parties announced an agreed settlement, and the settlement agreement was signed. The Court entered the Order approving the Plan of Allocation and awarding fees and expenses to plaintiffs' counsel.  The Court further entered the Order of Final Judgment and Dismissal as to the Dynacq.  The action is dismissed with prejudice. According to a press release dated August 11, 2006, Dynacq Healthcare, Inc. (Nasdaq SmallCap:DYII) (""Dynacq"") announced  that it has reached an agreement in principle to settle the shareholder class action lawsuit pending against it for the amount of $1.5 million. The amount of the settlement will include payment of all administrative costs and class attorneys' fees as well as the payout to the class. The $1.5 million will be paid $100,000 within 30 days of final approval of the settlement by the court and the balance in 36 equal monthly interest bearing installments beginning 30 days thereafter. The settlement will fully release the Company, its two executive officers named as defendants and its subsidiaries from liability and prohibits the filing of any future claims by the members of the class relating to this matter. Conditions to the effectiveness of the settlement are: no more than 5% of the class (both in number of shareholders and in percentage of total shares in the class) opting out, confirmation that the lead plaintiffs are adequate class representatives for the proposed settlement class, and the execution of definitive settlement and release agreements acceptable to the Company's Board and the Company's primary lender. In addition, acceptance of the settlement is subject to approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 31, 2006, in the second quarter of 2004, eight class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas alleging federal securities law causes of action against the Company and various current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs were persons who purchased shares of the Companys common stock on the open market generally during the period of January 14, 2003 through December 18, 2003. Under the procedures of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, the Court consolidated the actions and appointed lead plaintiffs in the matter. An amended complaint was filed on June 30, 2004, asserting a class period of November 27, 2002, through December 19, 2003 and naming additional defendants, including Ernst & Young, LLP, the Companys prior auditors. On July 30, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on September 30, 2004. All defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed two of the former officers from the case. The Court dismissed the claims against one former officer and Ernst & Young, LLP, but denied the motions to dismiss of the Company and two current officers who are defendants. The Court denied the Company??s and those two officers?? motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motions to dismiss. The Company and the two current officers fi"" an answer on September 30, 2005. The parties participated in a mediation of the case on April 17, 2006. The mediation has not resulted in a settlement. A hearing on plaintiffs?? motion for class certification, which the Company and the two current officers oppose, is scheduled for July 21, 2006. Trial is scheduled to begin on November 6, 2006.  The original Complaint alleges that Defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Plaintiff charges, inter alia, that the defendants fraudulently certified that  Dynacq's financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003 were  compiled in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""AAP"").  On December 2, 2003, the Company announced that it was requesting an automatic  extension of up to 15 days to file its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended August  31, 2003 with the SEC. On December 18, 2003, the Company announced that its  independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, had resigned due to the Company's ""lack  of internal controls necessary to develop reliable financial statements.""

Further, the Court entered the Findings on the Settlement and Allocation, approving the plan of allocation of the settlement.  Lastly, the Court entered the Final Judgment approving the settlement. According to a press release dated December 22, 2006, the court certified a class action. Under the proposed settlement, the defendants will pay $285 million. Of this, $273 million will be paid by El Paso and its insurers, and $12 million will be paid by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Hughes United States District Court March 6, 2007, at 9:00 a.m 515 Rusk Avenue Houston, Texas 77002.   In a press release dated August 2, 2006, El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EP) announced that it has reached settlements of its shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits. First, El Paso announced that it has reached agreement in principle to settle all shareholder class action litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of El Paso securities between February 22, 2000 and February 17, 2004. Under the terms of the agreement El Paso and its insurers will pay a total of $273 million to the plaintiffs. El Paso will contribute approximately $48 million and its insurers will contribute approximately $225 million. Since El Paso previously reserved a substantial portion of its contribution in prior periods, the settlement will have no material impact on its second quarter financial results. Within 45 days, the parties intend to submit a Stipulation of Settlement to the court seeking preliminary approval of this settlement. Second, El Paso settled an associated derivative lawsuit that made similar claims to those in the class action litigation. The settlement involved the payment of approximately $17 million which was fully funded by El Paso's insurers, of which approximately $12 million will be used to fund the settlement of the shareholder litigation. This settlement has been approved by the court. In a press release dated September 19, 2005, Attorneys for former Coastal chairman El Paso have begun negotiations on a settlement to a securities class-action lawsuit filed against the Houston-based independent producer El Paso and its former management, court papers show. Attorneys for the plaintiffs and defendants in the case told a status conference Sep 14 before Judge Lynn Hughes of the District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston they were in settlement discussions. Hughes Sep 9 had instructed attorneys for both sides to file ""a one-page proposal of what they believe needs to be done"" to settle. The suit was filed in July 2002 by El Paso shareholders alarmed at the precipitous drop in the value of their shares. Wyatt, one of the largest shareholders as a result of El Paso's acquisition of Coastal, was named lead plaintiff in October 2002. As summarized by a law firm??s website, on April 19, 2004, competing motions for the consolidation of all related cases and for the appointment of Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel were filed with the Court. On April 28, 2004, Judge L""n Hughes issued an order consolidating all related cases into an already pending action entitled Goldfarb v. El Paso Corp, Civil Action No. H-02-2717.  On May 26, 2004, a hearing was held and arguments were heard with regard to the appointment of Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel. On that same day, Judge Lynn N. Hughes signed an order changing the caption of the case to Oscar Wyatt v. El Paso Corp. and appointing Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel. On November 9, 2005, Judge Hughes signed an order amending the May 26, 2004 order and appointed Berman DeValerio Co-Lead Counsel and Oklahoma Firefighters Pension & Retirement System Co-Lead Plaintiff.  On July 2, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the ""2nd Consolidated Complaint"") which extends the Class Period to include all persons who purchased or acquired the securities of El Paso between February 22, 2000 and February 17, 2004, inclusive, and names as additional Defendants. On July 7, 2004 the Court issued an Order Staying the case and on July 14, 2004 issued an Order allowing Defendants to file their Motions to Dismiss and Plaintiffs to file their reply briefs. On August 26, 2004 Defendant Wise filed a Motion to Dismiss the 2nd Consolidated Complaint and on August 27, 2004 Defendants filed their Motions to Dismiss. Plaintiffs filed their oppositions to Defendants' motions on September 24, 2004 and Defendants filed their replies on October 14, 2004. On November 19, 2004, the Court issued an Order stating it will not rule on Defendants motions until the stay is lifted. On June 17, 2005, the Court issued an Order lifting the Stay. To date the Court has not yet ruled on Defendants Motions to Dismiss. In 2004, several purported securities class action complaints were filed against El Paso Corporation and subsequently consolidated with the existing lawsuit against El Paso first filed in 2002.  According to the complaint for the 2004 filing, the complaint alleges defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market during the Class Period thereby artificially inflating the price of El Paso securities. More specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants caused El Paso to report in its public filings, press releases and other public statements favorable financial results by, among other things, artificially inflating the Company's reported reserves as it relates to oil and natural gas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants failed to disclose that the Company's estimates were based on improperly manipulated reported reserve estimates that deviated from industry standards and resulted in a knowingly false high estimate of reported reserves. The complaint further alleges that on February 17, 2004, El Paso announced, that the Company had overstated its reported reserves by 41% or 1.8 trillion cubic feet and warned of a $1 billion pretax charge triggered by the revision. On this news, El Paso shares fell 18% and traded as low as $7.26 per share. As a result of Defendants' conduct, the complaint alleges, El Paso was able to inflate its stock price, maintain its credit rating, and maintain its status in the energy industry as a leader. On October 25, 2002, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New Y""rk. The case, Conner v. El Paso, et al., was later voluntarily dismissed and became part of this action against El Paso.  According to the complaint, the action was filed on behalf of purchasers of 9% Equity Security  Units of El Paso Corporation (""El Paso"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: EP.A) in the  public offering of the 9% Units on or about June 21, 2002, (the ""Offering"") or  traceable thereto, (the ""Class Period"") against defendants El Paso, certain of  its officers and directors, and the Underwriters of the Offering, Credit Suisse  First Boston and J.P. Morgan Securities. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15  of the Securities Act of 1933 by issuing  Equity Security Units pursuant to a  Prospectus and Registration Statement that were materially false and misleading  in its omission of material facts concerning the Company's true financial  condition, nature of its relationship with Credit Suisse First Boston, conflict  of interest of a senior executive, and participation in the California energy  crisis that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of the  Company's securities.  As a result of the Offering, defendants were able to sell the 9% Units at a price of $50 per Unit to unsuspecting public investors.  Since the Offering,  the price of the 9% Units declined to as low as $20.55 per unit (on September  24, 2002), leaving investors -- who were led by the prospectus to believe El  Paso was prepared to take advantage of its exceptional business practices -- with substantial losses on their investments. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Offering was achieved by means of a registration statement and prospectus which negligently failed to advise investors that El Paso had booked hundreds of millions of dollars in profits years before they would be actually realized while also keeping off of its books billions of dollars of debt.  Moreover, the Company manipulated the California energy market in the winter of 2000/2001 and, as a consequence of this malfeasance, artificially inflated the Company's reported results.

Ambassadors Group is an educational company that organizes and promotes international and domestic travel programs for youth, athletes, and professionals. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business prospects. Specifically, defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (a) that the Company was experiencing a lower conversion rate from people attending its informational meetings to booking travel (b) that there was a decrease in the number of enrolled participants for the Company's 2008 travel programs, especially in its international outbound programs (c) that the Company had utilized a different database in order to promote its travel programs to prospective clients and (d) as a result of the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company and its prospects. As a result of defendants false and misleading statements, Ambassadors Group stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, reaching a high of $40.99 per share on October 18, 2007. Then, on October 22, 2007, Ambassadors Group announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2007, the period ending September 30, 2007. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $22.5 million and $1.12 fully diluted earnings per share. The Company also announced that as of October 16, 2007, its net enrolled participants for 2008 travel programs were 26,200 compared to 37,300 participants as of the same date last year for its 2007 programs and that the decrease in net enrollments for its 2008 programs will negatively impact its 2008 earnings. In response to this announcement, the price of Ambassadors Group common stock fell $17.73 per share, or approximately 44%, to close at $21.04 per share.

EnergySolutions is a provider of specialized, technology-based nuclear services to government and commercial customers. More than 30 million EnergySolutions shares were sold to investors in the IPO at $23 per share raising approximately $765.90 million and 40.25 million shares were sold to investors in the July 2008 Offering at $19 per share raising approximately $764.75 million. Prior to the IPO, ENV Holdings held 100% of the shares of EnergySolutions, sold millions of shares in the IPO, and sold 100% of the shares to investors in the July 2008 Offering. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, and in the offering documents for the Offerings, defendants made numerous positive statements regarding the Companys financial condition, business and prospects. The complaint further alleges that these statements were inaccurate statements of material fact when made because defendants failed to disclose the following adverse facts, among others: (i) that economic problems in the United States and internationally were adversely affecting the Companys ability to secure projects which would adversely affect its future results (ii) that statements in the Companys offering documents for the Offerings about the opportunities in the nuclear industry were materially misleading because EnergySolutions was not well situated in the near term to benefit from those opportunities (iii) that on May 29, 2007 and prior to the IPO, the Company filed a petition for rulemaking (the Petition) requesting that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) change well-established and longstanding regulations to allow funds from licensees decommissioning trust funds to be used for the cost of disposal of major radioactive components that have been removed from reactors before the permanent cessation of operations (iv) that the business prospects of the Company, including the Companys license stewardship initiative, were heavily dependent upon a favorable ruling from the NRC on the Petition (v) that by the time of the Petition, the NRC had already addressed and rejected the issue raised by EnergySolutions in the Petition (vi) that the Company faced significant risks that the Petition would be rejected by the NRC because the NRC has long been clear that the purpose of the decommissioning trust funds is to ensure that licensees have adequate funds on hand for decommissioning activities at the time of license expiration and (vii) that the rule change sought by the Petition was considerably more difficult and was much riskier than represented. On October 14, 2008, EnergySolutions issued a press release that revealed, among other things, that the Company was reducing its estimates for net income, that the financial crisis would delay EnergySolutions?? ability to accelerate the decommissioning of nuclear power plant assets, and that the NRC denied the Petition for rulemaking change.

Under the terms of the settlement, which is subject to notice being provided to the class and final approval by the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, First BanCorp will pay the plaintiffs $74,250,000. In a press release dated February 1, 2007, following the previously announced internal review by the Corporation's Audit Committee, the Corporation and certain of its officers and directors and former officers and directors were named as defendants in separate class action lawsuits filed late in 2005. These securities class actions were later consolidated. First BanCorp has since been engaged in discussions with the lead plaintiff for a possible settlement of the class action and has accrued $74.25 million in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 in connection with a potential settlement. There can be no assurance that the amount accrued will be sufficient and the Corporation cannot predict at this time the timing or final terms of any settlement. First BanCorp has also been engaged in discussions with the staff of the SEC regarding a possible resolution of its investigation relating to the matters that resulted in the Corporation's restatement of its financial statements, and has accrued $8.5 million in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 in connection with a potential settlement of the SEC Staff's investigation of the Corporation. Any settlement is subject to the approval of the SEC.  On March 2, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.  On March 6, 2006, the Court entered the Notice signed by Judge Jed S. Rakoff.  According to the Notice, Lead Plaintiffs filed motions to transfer the action to the District of Puerto Rico to pursue claims in the related consolidated action, In re First BanCorp Securities Litigation, 05-CV-02148, pending before the Honorable Juan M. Perez-Gimenez.  The Lead Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss the consolidated action filed in the Southern District of New York without prejudice.  The action is currently pending in the District of Puerto Rico.  On February 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint.  The defendants responded by filing various motions to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint, which were granted in part and denied in part in an Opinion and Order entered on November 6, 2006. On December 13, 2005, the Court entered the Order consolidating the actions under 05-CV-9379 (Lead Case).  On January 18, 2006, the Court entered the Memorandum Order appointing co-lead plaintiffs and approving their respective counsel as co-lead counsel. On February 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Several purported shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed against First BanCorp and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the U.S. District Courts for the District of Puerto Rico and for the Southern District of New York. First BanCorp operates as the holding company for First Bank Puerto Rico, which provides various financial services in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands.  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants' statements made during Class Period concerning First Bancorp's earnings and financial condition were materially false and misleading when made because defendants failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's earnings quality had been significantly reduced by First Bancorp's use of overly aggressive accounting methodologies, specifically in its accounting classification of purchases of mortgage loans originated by other financial institutions; (2) the Company lacked adequate internal controls and was therefore unable to ascertain the true financial condition of First Bancorp; (3) the Company's financial statements were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (4) the Company's false and misleading accounting treatment of certain mortgage loans purchased would ultimately expose First Bancorp to regulatory scrutiny; and (5) that, as a result of the aforementioned, First Bancorp's reported net income and assets were materially overstated during the Class Period. The complaint further alleges that on or around August 25, 2005, the Company announced that it was subject to a SEC informal inquiry related to mortgage loans purchased by First Bancorp. On September 30, 2005, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer resigned from First Bancorp. On October 21, 2005, the Company announced that the SEC had issued a formal order of investigation into First Bancorp relating to, among other things, transactions in which the Company acquired substantial number of mortgage loans from other Puerto Rican financial institutions.",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The settlement requires final approval from the court, and no assurances can be given that the settlement will ultimately be approved. Neither the Company nor any of the other defendants admitted any wrongdoing in connection with the proposed settlement and, if finally approved, the settlement will result in the dismissal of all claims against all defendants.

On February 11, 2009, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of settlement, which the court granted on February 27, 2009. The judge consolidated all the related cases and appointed an individual investor a lead plaintiff on September 4, 2007.  A Consolidated Complaint was then filed on October 4.  Motions for dismissal were filed on November 20.  The motion was granted in part on April 23, 2008.  Answers to the remaining claims were filed in May. The Complaint alleges that on March 9, 2007, Sourcefire accomplished its IPO of 5,770,000 shares at $15.00 per share for estimated net proceeds of $71.8 million to Sourcefire pursuant to the Registration Statement that represented that Sourcefire??s revenues, gross profits and e""nings were materially increasing, reporting positive financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.  The Complaint further alleges that on April 9, 2007, Sourcefire issued a press release announcing its preliminary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 that disclosed, in part, that ""Historically, the first calendar quarter has been the slowest quarter of the year for us due to seasonal factors. This year, we saw an exaggeration of that trend due to a smaller than expected initial order from a substantial and strategic new account and an unusual number of transactions delayed or deferred very late in the quarter. This was particularly dramatic in the Federal sector where we saw a number of delays in the processing of awarded procurement transactions . . . ??  The Complaint alleges that on this news, Sourcefire??s stock price declined from $17.35 per share on April 5, 2007 to close at $12.28 per share on April 9, 2007, the next trading day, on volume of approximately 1.6 million shares.

The Securities Act claim is also bought against the underwriters of Fifth Third Capital Trust VI preferred securities, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated UBS Securities LLC. Banc of America Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. The Complaint asserts that during the Class Period, FITB issued materially false and misleading statements concerning the quality of the Companys Tier 1 capital, the relevant ratios and sufficiency of its Tier 1 capital, the necessity to take net charge-offs stemming from increasing credit losses, and the need to shore up capital due to the Companys exposure to poorly performing real estate markets in the Mid-West region. This Complaint further alleges that Trust Preferred Securities were sold to the investing public in the Offering pursuant to a Prospectus that negligently omitted material information. The statements made in the Companys Prospectus contained material omissions because, at the time of the Offering, FITB was already suffering from several adverse factors that were not revealed and or adequately addressed in the document. The omitted information included, but is not limited to, failure to disclose (a) the Companys exposure to certain poorly performing real estate markets, including Florida, Ohio, and Michigan, and the extent to which this exposure was materially increasing (b) the Companys growing exposure to late payments and defaults on mortgages and other non-performing loans, and the extent to which this exposure was materially increasing (c) the extent of the decline in the quality of the Companys Tier 1 capital base (d) the deteriorating credit trends and increasing expenses, including negative trends, in the Companys consumer loan portfolio, including the extent of the increase in late payments and defaults (e) the negative trends in the Companys home equity and commercial construction loans, and the extent to which there was a decrease in the value of the underlying assets and an increase in late payments and defaults and (f) the deterioration in the credit quality of its loans. The Companys president and chief executive officer, and FITBs underwriters could have  and should have  discovered the material misstatements and omissions in the Companys Prospectus prior to its filing with the SEC and distribution to the investing public. They, instead, failed to do so as a result of a negligent and grossly inadequate due diligence investigation. Certain of the adverse factors affecting FITBs business were first revealed on June 18, 2008, before the market opened. At that time, the Company issued a press release stating that it was forced to cut its quarterly dividend by 66.0%, to 15 cents from 44 cents a share, and had to sell non-core businesses for at least $1.0 billion in extra capital. The Company also stated it planned to raise $1.0 billion through an offering of convertible preferred shares, which would prove dilutive to common shareholders. The Company further stated that earnings would be reduced by a provision expense expected to be between $350.0 million and $375.0 million greater than net charge-offs for the second quarter.

During the Class Period, as alleged in the complaint, the Company issued statements that failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts, among others: (a) that the Company's declining revenues and earnings during 2001 and 2002 would have caused the Company to violate its loan covenants but for its public stock offerings, which enabled the Company to reduce its debt, obtain favorable interest rates and debt refinancings from lenders, and enable Flowserve to fund the acquisition of the Flow Control Division (""IFC"") of Invensys plc, among other things (b) that demand for the Company's products had materially declined, especially its aftermarket sales or ""quick-turnaround business"" resulting in revenue and earnings shortfalls (c) that the Company's recent acquisitions, including Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Co. (""IDP"") and IFC, had not materially altered the Company's dependence on revenue streams from the Chemical industry, or further stabilized its aftermarket revenue streams for its pump and valve business through significant cross-selling opportunities, among other things (d) that the Company's reorganizations, downsizing and facility closures, following its acquisition of Innovative Valve Technologies, Inc. (""Invatec""), IDP and IFC had failed to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity resulting in the material erosion of the Company's gross margins and earnings (e) that the Company had severe and continuing integration problems following the acquisition of Invatec, resulting in a disruption of the Company's service and maintenance operations and contributing to the decline in Flowserve's high margin service revenues, eventually necessitating the reorganization of the Company's service business segment and (f) based on the foregoing, defendants' opinions, projections and forecasts concerning the Company and its operations were  lacking in a reasonable basis at all times. On September 27, 2002, the Company warned of a 21% earnings shortfall for the quarter ending September 30, 2002, and cut its full year 2002 earnings guidance by over 60%, to $1.45 per share, from the $2.30 per share earnings guidance shared with investors during roadshow presentations promoting Flowserve's public offerings less than six months prior. Market reaction to the Company's  announcement was swift and severe. Flowserve shares fell over 38% to close at  $8.70 on September 27, 2002, a decline of more than 75% from the Class Period high of $34.90 reached on May 2, 2002.  Prior to the disclosure of the true facts, Flowserve completed two public offerings of its common stock, thereby raising more than $433.9 million, and Flowserve insiders sold their personally-held Flowserve common stock, generating millions in proceeds. According to the companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2009, in 2003, related lawsuits were filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging that we violated federal securities laws. After these cases were consolidated, the lead plaintiff amended its complaint several times. The lead plaintiffs last pleading was the fifth consolidated amended complaint (the Complaint). The Complaint alleged that federal securities violations occurred between February 6, 2001 and September 27, 2002 and named as defendants our company, C. Scott Greer, our former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Renee J. Hornbaker, our former Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and Banc of America Securities LLC and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, which served as underwriters for our two public stock offerings during the relevant period.

The lead plaintiff sought unspecified compensatory damages, forfeiture by Mr. Greer and Ms. Hornbaker of unspecified incentive-based or equity-based compensation and profits from any stock sales and recovery of costs.

According to the docket, both parties moved for private mediation in lieu of a settlement conference.  Those motions were granted on August 17, 2007. The original complaint alleges that defendants, GMH Communities Trust and certain of its officers and directors, disseminated false and misleading financial statements in a scheme to inflate the earnings of the Company and issued dividends in violation of loan covenants in order to drive the price of its stock higher. The higher stock price allowed the Company to sell a secondary offering in October 2005 on more favorable terms. Defendants portrayed the Company as a growing real estate investment trust in a particular niche market, student and marketing housing and military housing, paying high dividends. Unbeknownst to the market, the Company's strong earnings were the result of accounting fraud. As part of the Company's closing of its books on fiscal year 2005, GMH's chief financial officer wrote to the Audit Committee indicating that there were problems with the ""tone at the top"" of the Company's management. In response to the letter, the Audit Committee conducted an investigation which indicated, among other things, material weaknesses in internal controls, pressure by key executives on the accounting function and the need for adjustments in the financial statements in current and prior accounting periods. In addition, the Company's issuance of $0.91 in 2005 dividends exceeded the 110% of funds from operations per share limitation under the loan covenants of its credit facility. The stock dropped 23% on the news from a close of $16.83 on March 10 to close at $12.90 on March 13. On March 31, 2006, the Company announced the continued delay in filing its 2005 annual report and that it expected to restate its prior previously reported financial results due to improper capitalization of expenses and the improper timing of recognition of revenue and expenses. Since the initial disclosure of the audit committee investigation, the Company has lost almost $224 million in market capitalization, closing at $11.21 on April 3, 2006 following the March 31, 2006 disclosure.",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The complaint alleges that in an effort to allow Gilead insiders to sell their Gilead stock at artificially inflated prices, defendants falsely represented that strong sales of Viread, the Company's HIV drug, during the second quarter of 2003 was due to an increase in prescriptions and not, as some analysts had cautioned, due to inventory build-up by distributors stocking up ahead of a price increase. Such statements were materially false and misleading because, as defendants knew or recklessly disregarded, a material portion of the second quarter Viread sales were attributable to distributors stocking up ahead of a price increase. Gilead insiders sold a total of 303,981 shares in August 2003 at artificially inflated prices, reaping gross proceeds of $19,365,998. On October 28, 2003, Gilead announced that sales of Viread in the third quarter of 2003 would be materially less than expected because distributors would meet end-user demand for Viread by selling off overstock they accumulated in the second quarter. In reaction to this announcement, the price of Gilead common stock plummeted, falling $7.46 in one day, from a close of $59.46 per share on October 28, 2003 to $52 per share on October 29, 2003.

On February 9, 2004, the court issued an order appointing lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action. On April 30, 2004, the lead plaintiffs, on behalf of the purported class, filed their consolidated amended complaint. On June 21, 2004, the Company and individual defendants filed their motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 4, 2005, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on February 25, 2005 and a third amended complaint on March 11, 2005. On October 11, 2005, the court granted the defendants notion to dismiss the third amended complaint with leave to amend. On December 2, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a fourth consolidated amended complaint. The court heard defendants motion to dismiss on February 21, 2006, took the matter under submission and has yet to render its decision.    On May 12, the Court entered the Order signed by U.S. District Judge Martin J. Jenkins granting the defendants?? motion to dismiss.  Three days later, on May 15, 2006, the Court entered Judgment and the civil case was terminated. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal.  According to a press release dated August 12, 2008, a California appeals court reinstated a securities class action lawsuit on Monday against Gilea""Sciences that claimed the drug maker misled investors about demand for its HIV drug Viread, Reuters reports.  The lawsuit accused Gilead of fostering demand for Viread by using improper marketing, including aggressively promoting off-label uses for the drug after US regulators ordered the company to stop.  The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a San Francisco district court's decision to dismiss the case on the grounds that investors had failed to prove that their 2003 stock losses were related to the off-label sales and to alleged false statements the company made about Viread.  ""Gilead's fortunes, as reflected in its stock price, depended heavily on Viread's commercial success,"" the appeals court wrote in its opinion. ""Ultimately, 75 per cent to 95 per cent of Viread sales resulted from off-label marketing efforts,"" the court said.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that during the December 2001 and March 2002 quarters, Genesis shipped approximately 12.3 million computer chips to its customers. However, unbeknownst to investors, and as defendants acknowledged at the end of the Class Period, four million of those units built-up in customers inventory during that period as Genesis customers were unable to secure flat screen panels for assembly with Genesis computer chips. Defendants, Genesis most senior executives, had actual knowledge or the ability to obtain knowledge of the build-up of inventory by virtue of their close working relationship with Genesis customers, and were deliberately reckless to the truth concerning that build-up of excess inventory  especially where that build-up in inventory was reflected in reduced orders for Genesis products at the beginning of the Class Period. The amended complaint alleges that in an April 29, 2002 press release and investor conference call that begins the Class Period (i) defendants denied that there had been any build-up in inventory with their customers, and represented that (ii) Genesis customers had been the first to receive panels for assembly with Genesis products, (iii) Genesis was not seeing any shrinkage in our volumes due to panel supply constraints, (iv) Genesis had good visibility?? on revenue growth through the end of 2002, and (v) that Genesis?? chips would be shipped in ??synch?? with the manufacturing of computer monitors by its customers during the June 2002 quarter. Plaintiff and other members of the Class purchased Genesis common stock as Genesis?? stock price rose from $20.25 per share on April 29, 2002 to $28.40 per share on May 16, 2002, in reliance on the truth and accuracy of defendants?? public statements. The amended complaint further alleges that on June 14, 2002, before the opening of the U.S. securities markets, defendants belatedly acknowledged that, contrary to their Class Period representations, they had actual knowledge that demand had weakened for Genesis products by the time of their April",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

Globalstar offers satellite communications services. The Company provides mobile and fixed voice and data services, asset tracking and monitoring services, high-speed Internet acce""s, video and audio broadcasting, and remote file transfer and virtual private networking services. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on or about November 2, 2006, the Prospectus (the ""Prospectus"") with respect to the IPO, which forms part of the Registration Statement, became effective and, at least, 7.5 million shares of Globalstar's common stock were sold to the public, thereby raising more than $127 million. The Prospectus failed to disclose that Globalstar's constellation of satellites was degrading at an increasingly fast rate and the length of their commercial viability was decreasing. The complaint further alleges that on or around February 5, 2007, Globalstar filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing several material events. Among other things, the Company disclosed that it has received updated information concerning its constellation of satellites and that the satellites' rate of degradation had accelerated. In response to the announcement about the Company's satellites, on February 6, 2007, the price of Globalstar stock declined precipitously falling from $14.48 per share to $10.40 per share - approximately 39% below the IPO price - on extremely heavy trading volume.

The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants misled investors regarding the status of Hemispherx's New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Ampligen with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). Specifically, defendants failed to disclose and misrepresented the fact that the FDA had requested several reports from the Company before the NDA could even be considered, thus delaying the possible approval of Ampligen by several months at a minimum.  On November 2, 2009, when the Company belatedly disclosed this information, the per share price of Hemispherx's common stock dropped from $1.45 on the previous day to $1.13, a drop of more than 20%.

The complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements. The true facts, which were known by each of the defendants but concealed from the investing public during the Class Period, were as follows: (a) that the Company was paying illegal and concealed ""contingent commissions"" pursuant to illegal ""contingent commission agreements (b) that by concealing these contingent commissions"" and such ""contingent commission agreements"" the defendants violated applicable principles of fiduciary law, subjecting the Company to enormous fines and penalties totaling potentially tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars and (c) that as a result, the Company's prior reported revenue and income was grossly overstated. The complaint further alleges that on October 14, 2004, New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer announced that he had charged several of the nation's largest insurance companies and the largest broker with bid rigging and pay-offs that he claimed violated fraud and competition laws. On these revelations, the Company's shares fell to $56 per share, a drop of 9%.

The consolidated amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of shareholders that the Company and the four named individual defendants, as control persons of the Company, failed to disclose to the investing public that The Hartfords business and growth was predicated on the unlawful activity alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is August 6, 2003 through October 13, 2004, the day before the NYAG Complaint was filed. The complaint seeks damages and attorneys fees. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in June 2005, and, on July 13, 2006, the district court granted the motion. The plaintiffs have noticed an appeal of the dismissal.

The Company believes that it is in its best interests to avoid the cost, management distraction and risk associated with a trial, currently scheduled for August 2008. The tentative agreement is subject to certain contingencies, including execution of a definitive agreement and court approval. The agreement will provide a full release of Harmonic and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations in the lawsuit without any admission of fault on the part of Harmonic or its officers and directors. The cost of the settlement is $15 million, plus an estimated aggregate of $1.4 million in related legal fees and expenses in connection with proceedings in the securities class action and derivative lawsuits. Of this aggregate cost of settlement, Harmonic will pay $6.4 million and the Company' s insurance carriers, having funded most litigation costs to date, will contribute the remaining $10 million.

A case management conference was held on January 25, 2007, at which the Court set a trial date in August 2008, with discovery to close in February 2008. The Court also ordered the parties to attend a settlement conference with a magistrate judge or a private mediation before June 30, 2007. Mediation has been scheduled for the parties on May 24, 2007. As summarized by the same SEC filing, on November 8, 2005, the Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings the decision of the District Court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs fraud claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act with prejudice, finding that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their allegations of fraud. The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act, however, finding that those claims did not allege fraud and therefore were subject to only minimal pleading standards. Regarding the secondary liability claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act, the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal of that claim against Anthony J. Ley, Harmonics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and affirmed the dismissal of that claim against Harmonic, while granting leave to amend. The Ninth Circuit remanded the surviving claims to the District Court for further proceedings. On November 22, 2005, both the Harmonic defendants and the plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit for a rehearing of the appeal. On February 16, 2006 the Ninth Circuit denied both petitions. On May 17, 2006 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on the issues remanded for further proceedings by the Ninth Circuit, to which the Harmonic defendants responded with a motion to dismiss certain claims and to strike certain allegations.

The actions subsequently were consolidated. A consolidated complaint, filed on December 7, 2000, was brought on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased Harmonics publicly traded securities between January 19 and June 26, 2000. The complaint also alleged claims on behalf of a purported subclass of persons who purchased C-Cube Microsystems Inc., or C-Cube, securities between January 19 and May 3, 2000. In addition to Harmonic and certain of its officers and directors, the complaint also named C-Cube and several of its officers and directors as defendants.

The complaint also alleged that certain defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ??Securities Act??) by filing a false or misleading registration statement, prospectus, and joint proxy in connection with th""-",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

Moreover, the Registration Statement failed to disclose the staggering number of injuries suffered by Heelys users in the months leading up to the IPO. The Company and certain of its senior executives and directors sold $155 million worth of Heelys stock at $21 per share in the IPO. The complaint further alleges that on or around August 8, 2007, following the issuance of product safety warnings by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and other industry safety groups that affected the shoes marketability, defendants were forced to significantly downgrade the Companys revenue and earnings guidance for the second half of 2007, admitting that retailers were sitting on huge unsold inventory and refusing to place additional orders.

The original complaint charges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by  issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market,  and by failing to disclose material information that plaintiffs contend  defendants had a duty to disclose, between January 4, 2000 and July 25, 2003.  More specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants made material  misrepresentations and/or omitted to make material disclosures during the Class  Period concerning the efficacy, testing and market acceptance of OssaTron(R),  its leading product for the treatment of heel pain. Among other things, the  complaint charges, defendants failed to disclose that some of the Company's own  tests failed to support defendants' statements that OssaTron(R) was more  effective, safer and less costly than alternative, non-surgical treatments for  heel pain. In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants misrepresented  the market acceptance of OssaTron(R) because Defendants knew, or were severely  reckless in disregarding at the time these statements were made, that serious  questions existed among the medical community concerning the effectiveness of  extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) for heel pain, which in turn raised  serious issues as to whether insurance carriers and other third party payors  would cover OssaTron(R) procedures.

The settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of a formal settlement agreement and to final Court approval. The proposed settlement provides for a payment to the plaintiffs of $1.9 million, which amount will be funded entirely by the Company's insurance carrier.

The district court dismissed the shareholders' claims with regard to the allegations that the company overstated its prospects for booking orders for its products. Shareholders of Ibis Technology Corp. sued Ibis for securities fraud violations for overstating its prospects for booking orders for i2000 implanter machines by the end of the year 2003. The shareholders also claime"" that Ibis failed to reduce the value of its small wafer production line in its books. ??The district court ruled that the shareholders adequately pled scienter with regard to the $11 million overstatement in Ibis' books because the facts showed that Ibis was in a cash crunch, laid-off large numbers of its workforce and needed immediate cash to remain viable. However, as to the predictions of sales of the i2000, the district court ruled that the claim was not adequately pleaded. On March 4, 2004, a complaint was filed against Ibis Technology Corporation and its senior executive officer and Chairman, civil action no. 04-CV-10446.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose that at the time of its analyst conference call on April 5, 2005, which was purportedly to discuss the impact of expensing options under SFAS 123R, (1) the Company was experiencing significant operational issues in multiple areas of its business. In particular, the Company had been unable to close significant transactions late in the first quarter, it was experiencing elongated sales cycles, and was having product-transition problems in its hardware segment. (2) The Company intentionally accelerated the adoption of SFAS 123R, despite having an additional two quarters to implement it, in order to sufficiently lower analyst expectations so that when it later disclosed the operational issues and reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.85 per share for the first quarter 2005, it would have the effect of cushioning the blow of the significant earnings miss. (3) The Company intentionally misrepresented the impact from expensing options, indicating an earnings impact of $0.14 per share on April 5, 2005 (versus the actual impact of $0.10 per share reported on April 14, 2005), in order to disguise a significant and material operating miss. The complainy further alleges that on April 14, 2005, IBM reported first quarter 2005 financial results. The Company posted net income of $1.4 billion, or $0.84 per share, which represented an additional miss of $0.06 per share, undisclosed nine days earlier. The Company also revealed that the miss was significantly attributable to operations, rather than wholly attributable to SFAS 123R, as the Company had previously indicated. Shares reacted negatively to the news, falling from $83.64 per share on April 14, 2005, to $76.70 per share on April 15, 2005. Before the markets opened on evening, April 18, 2005, the Wall Street Journal published an article characterizing IBM's April 5, 2005 announcement as ""clouding"" IBM's true financial position, and ""cushioning the blow"" of its earnings miss. On May 4, 2005, IBM announced that it would be reducing its workforce by 10,000 to 13,000 employees. On June 27, 2005, the Company announced that the SEC had begun an informal investigation into the Company's statements regarding the earnings miss.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges, among other things, that the Registration Statements and Prospectuses included representations that the Company's business had grown due to successful deployments in""Japan. In fact, according to the Complaint, the deployments in Japan had grown because Ikanos had shipped excessive product to Japanese customers in excess of those customers' needs and the Registration Statements and Prospectuses failed to disclose that the Company's future results would be adversely affected by this practice. The complaint further alleges that on October 4, 2006, Ikanos issued a press release announcing preliminary third quarter revenue results and stated that the revenue expectations were $4-6 million lower than expected, and the fourth quarter revenue results would be adversely affected due to, among other things, ""carriers in Japan () currently working through their existing equipment levels.""

The complaints, which are substantially similar to one another, allege, among other things, that the plaintiffs were injured by reason of certain allegedly false and misleading statements made by the Company relating to the expected benefits of the THG Acquisition. Joint lead plaintiffs were appointed on June 9, 2006. The lead plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on August 25, 2006 naming the Company, the Company??s Consumer Solutions segment and certain officers of the Company as defendants (collectively ??Defendants??) and containing substantially the same allegations as in the initial complaints.

On October 19, 2004, JAKKS announced that it was ""engaged in discussions with WWE [World Wrestling Entertainment] concerning the restructuring of its toy license and with WWE and THQ with respect to the restructuring of the JAKKS THQ Joint Venture video games license agreement with WWE."" In response to the announcement of the problems with the WWE licenses, the price of JAKKS stock declined from $24.15 per share on October 18, 2004, to $18.81 per share on October 19, 2004. Then, after the market closed for trading, it was reported that the WWE had just filed a lawsuit against JAKKS which alleged that the videogame license and certain toy licenses that WWE had previously granted to JAKKS were obtained through a pattern of racketeering and commercial bribery and seeking, among other things, that the licensing agreements be declared void. Following this announcement, on the next day of trading, the price of JAKKS common stock continued to fall to close at $12.96 per share on extremely heavy trading volume.

On November 20, 2006, the Court consolidated the two actions as In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. C06-04327-JW, and appointed the New York City Pension Funds as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2007, and filed an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on April 9, 2007. The Amended Consolidated Complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by manipulating stock option grant dates to coincide with low stock prices and issuing false and misleading statements including, among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper accounting of stock option grants. The Amended Consolidated Complaint asserts claims for violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Juniper Networks?? publicly traded securities from July 12, 2001, through and including August 10, 2006.

Specifically, defendants failed to disclose the following: (i) the Company had overinvested in inventories of fall clothing, building excessive levels of in-stock inventories of seasonal merchandise that carried over into the first quarter of 2006 (ii) that the Company resorted to very aggressive promotional pricing in February and March 2006 which deeply discounted the prices of the merchandise in order to move the merchandise and make room for new seasonal merchandise and (iii) the Company's gross profit margins were substantially reduced in February and March 2006 by reason of the inventory and pricing actions taken by defendants which caused the Company's profit margins and profits in February and March 2006 to shrink dramatically even as sales revenues increased, which represented an extreme departure from Jos. A. Bank's historical pattern. The complaint further alleges that on or around June 8, 2006, defendants announced that net income for the first quarter of 2006 had fallen 13% even as sales revenues increased 18%.

The original complaint alleges that this is a class action on behalf of all persons, other than defendants, who held shares of the common stock of J.P. Morgan Chase, either on April 2, 2004 (the record date for voting at the May 25, 2004 shareholder meeting), or at any time from April 19, 2004 (the date of the proxy statement associated with such meeting (the ""Proxy Statement"")) through July 1, 2004, (the date on which the Company consummated a merger with Bank One Corporation (""Bank One"")) which was approved by shareholders pursuant to the above-dated materially false and misleading proxy statement. The merger was consummated following shareholder approval of a 15% premium in favor of Bank One, but defendants never disclosed that Bank One offered to consummate the merger without demanding a premium for its shares and that J.P. Morgan Chase's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Defendant William B. Harrison, rejected that offer so he could prolong his executive tenure. This selfish action (the facts of which are omitted from the proxy statement's discussions of related issues - namely, the merger negotiation and approval process, the exchange ratio, and Mr. Harrison's continued employment) ultimately cost J.P. Morgan Chase shareholders over $7 billion in merger compensation.

As disclosed by the same SEC filing, on or about October 16, 2003 through December 16, 2003, nine purported class action lawsuits were filed by purchasers of the Companys common stock in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  On March 22, 2004, the court consolidated these lawsuits under the caption In re LaBranche Securities Litigation, No. 03 CV 8201.

On June 7, 2004, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. On July 12, 2004, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint. Plaintiffs allege that they represent a class consisting of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period beginning on August 19, 1999 and concluding on October 15, 2003. Plaintiffs allege that the Company, LaBranche & Co. LLC, and certain of its and/or LaBranche & Co. LLC??s past or present officers and/or directors, including George M.L. LaBranche, IV, William J. Burke, III, James G. Gallagher, Alfred O. Hayward, Jr., Robert M. Murphy and Harvey S.

Plaintiffs also allege that Mr. Gallagher violated Section 20A of the Exchange Act a"" two other of our past or present officers and/or directors, S. Lawrence Prendergast and George E. Robb, Jr., also violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek unspecified money damages, attorneys?? fees and reimbursement of expenses. According to a press release dated February 18, 2004, LaBranche & Co. agreed with financial regulators to settle investigations into possible floor trading abuses. Under an agreement in principle, LaBranche said it would pay a total of $63.5 million in restitution to customers and civil penalties for some trades that occurred from 1999 to 2003.  The complaint charges LaBranche, G. Michael LaBranche, Robert Murphy, Alfred O.  Haywood, Jr., William J. Burke, III, and Harvey S. Traison with violations of  Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5  promulgated thereunder. LaBranche is a specialty firm on the New York Stock  Exchange (""YSE""). As a specialist on the NYSE, LaBranche is required to uphold  the rules and requirements of the NYSE. Rather than uphold its duties,  LaBranche, during the class period, repeatedly violated its duties by engaging  in an illegal scheme to drive up the Company's financial results. More  specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Company's statements concerning  its financial results during the class period were materially false and  misleading because they failed to disclose and misrepresented the following  adverse facts, among others: (1) that LaBranche engaged in the illegal practice  of ""front-running"" trades at the NYSE, which allowed LaBranche to act on  nonpublic information to trade ahead of customers lacking that knowledge and  pocket a profit on each trade (2) that LaBranche illegally ""traded ahead"" of  customer orders by causing or allowing its traders to put LaBranche's own  interest ahead of investors by ignoring one investor order while in the process  of interacting with another investor, thereby creating more illegal profits for  the Company (3) that LaBranche, throughout the Class Period, improperly  recognized revenue from its illegal scheme in violation of Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") and (4) as a result of this illegal scheme,  LaBranche materially overstated and artificially inflated its earnings, net  income, and earnings per share.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that on April 17, 2003, the NYSE issued a statement wherein it disclosed that it had  begun an investigation of the specialist firms of the NYSE. On news of this  shares of LaBranche fell 7.8% or $1.41 per share to close at $16.49 per share.  On April 18, 2003, The Wall Street Journal reported that LaBranche and others  were the subject of an investigation by the NYSE into illegal trading practices  on the floor of the NYSE. Additionally on April 18, 2003, Bloomberg reported  that the SEC had also begun an investigation into illegal trading practices by  specialist firms, such as LaBranche.

Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that Magma faced the serious risk of infringing on intellectual property rights of competitor Synopsys because inventions that were critical to Magma's business, and which were patented by Magma, were designed by Magma's chief scientist while employed by Synopsys. Defendants aggressively denounced the allegations, characterizing them as completely baseless. While Magma's stock price was artificially inflated, insiders sold 4,436,163 shares of common stock reaping gross proceeds of $82,385,174. The complaint further alleges that on or around April 13, 2005, the market learned that Magma's Chief Scientist admitted, in a sworn declaration filed in the Synopsys infringement action, that inventions covered by two of Magma's patents were conceived by him while he was employed by Synopsys and that his supervisor at Magma, and likely others, knew that the inventions covered by the patents were conceived by him at Synopsis and were encompassed by an agreement with Synopsis granting Synopsis the rights to those inventions. On this news, Magma's stock plummeted 40.7%, from $9.42 per share on April 12, 2005 to $5.58 per share on April 13, 2005. Also included are all those who acquired Magma's shares through its acquisitions of Majave, Random Logic, Aplus Design or Silicon Metrics. As summarized by the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 1, 2009, on June 13, 2005, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit captioned The Cornelia I. Crowell GST Trust vs. Magma Design Automation, Inc., Rajeev Madhavan, Gregory C. Walker and Roy E. Jewell., No. C 05 02394, was filed in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose information regarding the risk of Magma infringing intellectual property rights of Synopsys, Inc., in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and prays for unspecified damages. In March 2006, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiff filed a further amended complaint in June 2006, which defendants again moved to dismiss. Defendants motion was granted in part and denied in part by an order dated August 18, 2006, which dismissed claims against two of the individual defendants. On November 30, 2007, the parties agreed to a settlement. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 7, 2008.

Leap is a wireless communications carrier that offers digital wireless service under the Cricket Communications, Inc. and Jump Mobile brands in the United States. Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business, prospects and financial results. As a result of defendants false statements, Leap stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, reaching its all-time high of $98.33 per share in July 2007. On August 7, 2007, Leap announced disastrous second quarter 2007 results, including missing its revenue projections, soaring expenses and a high customer turnover rate, causing its stock to decline from $80.36 per share on August 7, 2007 to $60.00 per on August 8, 2007  a one-day decline of 25%. Then, on November 9, 2007, before the market opened, defendants disclosed that Leap would be required to restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006 and for the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2007 to correct for errors in its previously reported service revenues, equipment revenues and operating expenses, causing its stock to drop $21.38 per share. According to the complaint, the true facts, which were known by the defendants but concealed from the investing public during the Class Period, were as follows: (a) the Companys financial statements were materially misstated due to its failure to properly account for its service revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) (b) the Companys financial statements were materially misstated due to its failure to properly account for its equipment revenue and cost of equipment in violation of GAAP (c) the Company lacked requisite internal controls, and, as a result, the Companys projections and reported results issued during the Class Period were based upon defective assumptions and/or manipulated facts and (d) given the Companys exposure to subprime consumers and the intense competition in the low-cost cell carriers market Leap was facing, the Company had no reasonable basis to make projections about its ability to maintain its customer turnover rate and net customer additions. As a result, the Companys projections issued during the Class Period were at a minimum reckless. On May 22, 2008, U.S. District Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the motions to consolidate several actions and granted the motions to appoint New Jersey Carpenters Pension and Benefit Fund as lead plaintiff and approving lead counsel selection.  On July 7, 2008, the plaintiff filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. On August 28, 2008, the defendants PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Leap Wireless International, Inc., and the individual defendants filed three separate motions to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants' statements about its sales projections were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts: (1) that LeapFrog was aware that its retail customers' orders were less than LeapFrog had forecast (2) that LeapFrog was aware that Mattel's PowerTouch was outperforming LeapFrog's LeapPad line where LeapFrog's retail customers had decreased or not placed additional orders for LeapFrog products (3) that LeapFrog was aware that its third quarter 2003 projections would not be met because retail customers' orders were less than expected and some retail customers had delayed shipment until the fourth quarter 2003 and (4) that as a result of the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their sale projections for the Company, which were therefore materially false  and misleading. The complaint further alleges that on October 21, 2003, LeapFrog announced that it missed its third quarter 2003 sales projection of $225 to $235 million with net sales for the third quarter of $203.9 million. The Company indicated that sales projections were not met because retail customers' orders were less than expected, and some retail customers had delayed shipment until the fourth quarter 2003. The market  reacted swiftly to this news, with the Company's stock falling 25%, or $11.65 per share, to close at $34.89 per share on October 22, 2003. On April 28, 2005, a complaint was filed charging LeapFrog and certain of its officers and directors (collectively the ""defendants"") with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 resulting from defendants' false and misleading statements and omissions, which artificially inflated the price of LeapFrog's stock during the Class Period, February 11, 2004, through October 18, 2004, inclusive, causing harm to LeapFrog's investors. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants continually assured investors that LeapFrog had taken the necessary steps to correct the problems in its IT systems and supply chain infrastructure (and that these efforts had been successful) and misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company had not in fact materially improved either its IT systems or its supply chain infrastructure and (ii) these issues were continuing to have a materially negative effect on its business and on its ability to accurately forecast results and meet analysts' sales and earnings expectations. The Complaint further claims that on October 18, 2004, LeapFrog announced that its 2004 earnings would miss its estimates by more than 60% due, in large part, to its failure to correct the IT and supply chain problems it said it had taken steps to correct. The announcement prompted a large sell-off of LeapFrog shares, which fell 34% in a single day, to a then all-time low of $11.99. Since then, LeapFrog has also missed fourth quarter estimates by a wide margin and replaced three members of its senior management, including its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. According to a press release dated August 2, 2005, the court-appointed lead plaintiff in In re LeapFrog Enterprises Sec. Litig., No. C-03-05421 RMW. Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP announced that they filed a consolidated class action complaint on June 17, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of purchasers of LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. class A common stock and options during the period between July 24, 2003 and October 18, 2004. According to a press release dated August 4, 2005, the law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. announced that a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of purchasers of the securities of LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc. from July 24, 2003, through October 18, 2004, inclusive, was filed on June 17, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  Notice of this filing was first announced on August 3, 2005, pursuant to a July 5, 2005 Court Order, a copy of which can be found at www.cmht.com. The July 5 Order was prompted by the fact that the consolidated class action complaint filed on June 17, 2005  encompassed a substantially different class period and different allegations than the July 24, 2003 to February 10, 2004 class period for which the Court had previously appointed Alice Cupples and William Sullivan as lead plaintiffs in an April 6, 2005 order. The new class period and allegations encompassed by the Consolidated Complaint include new allegations about LeapFrog's supply chain and IT system. Similar allegations about LeapFrog's supply chain and IT system had already been made in a different class action complaint filed on April 25, 2005 by the law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. on behalf of the Parnassus Fund and the Parnassus Equity Fund and other purchasers of LeapFrog securities between February 11, 2004 and October 18, 2004. In the July 5 Order, the Court found that ""the new claims and new scope of the (Consolidated Complaint) necessitates new notice and lead plaintiff selection."" The Court further noted that ""(t)he fact that Parnassus claims to be an institutional investor with losses of over $10 million, while the Cupples Movants are individuals with alleged losses of only approximately $36,000 reinforces the conclusion that Parnassus may be better-suited to represent the class under the amended LeapFrog complaint.""

The purported results of these misstatements were artificially inflated stock prices during the company's initial public offering (IPO) and a 46% price drop following Limelight's first performance statements as a public company. Headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, Limelight provides digital media content delivery network services for traditional and emerging media companies throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

All of the New York cases were transferred to Arizona and consolidated into a single action. The plaintiffs consolidated complaint asserted causes of action under Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on behalf of a purported class of individuals who purchased the Companys common stock in its initial public offering and/or pursuant to its Prospectus. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company omitted and/or misstated certain facts concerning the seasonality of its business and the loss of revenue related to certain customers.

The complaint alleges that, during the class period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the companys business and prospects. Specifically, the plaintiffs asset that the defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (a) that the company was experiencing significant performance issues with several projects in the Information Systems & Global Systems (IS&GS) division and would not be receiving anticipated awards (b) that growth in the IS&GS division was slowing as the company lost contracts and other contract awards were contested and (c) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the company, its earnings and prospects. On July 21, 2009, the company announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2009. Among other things, the company reported disappointing results in its IS&GS division. Following the issuance of the press release, the company held a conference call to discuss the reported earnings and the companys operations. During the conference call, defendants described the problems facing the IS&GS division and admitted that the company was not performing according to expectations in that important division. In response to information that the IS&GS division was not performing according to expectations and had not generated anticipated fee awards, the price of the company??s common stock declined from $82.11 per share to $75.13 per share on extremely heavy trading volume.

The district court denied the attorneys' request to recover expenses in the amount of $100,000. Lattice Semiconductor Corp. entered into an agreement with shareholders to settle a securities fraud class action for $3.5 million.  On November 6, 2006, the Court granted the motion for settlement.  That day, the Court entered the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice signed by U.S. District Judge Ann L. Aiken. According to a press release dated March 16, 2006, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2004 against the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers. The agreement does not contain any admission of fault or wrongdoing on the part of Lattice or any of the individual defendants in the litigation. The agreement in principle contemplates that plaintiffs will receive a payment of $3,500,000 in exchange for a release of the Company and the individual defendants from all claims asserted in the litigation. Lattice expects that the entire amount of the settlement will be paid by its insurer under the terms of its director and officer liability insurance policy, and that payment of the settlement amount will not affect Lattice's current or future financial results. The agreement in principle is subject to the negotiation and completion of the usual and customary documentation for such a settlement, including a Stipulation of Settlement, and is subject to and conditioned upon final court approval.  On January 13, 2004, the Court entered the Order granting the motion to appoint lead plaintiff.  On January 27, 2005, a Consolidated Class Action Complaint was filed.  The defendants responded by filing motions to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On January 3, 2006, the Court entered the Order denying the motions to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint.   The original complaint alleges that Defendants Lattice and certain of its officers and directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the complaint alleges that in knowing or reckless disregard of the truth and/or as part of their ongoing efforts to continue the illusion of Lattice's growth in the semiconductor industry, Defendants issued and or participated in the issuance of materially false and misleading statements and financial information. More specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period Defendants: 1) materially understated its accounts payable balance 2) overstated earnings by a material amount 3) falsely represented that the Company's financial results during the Class Period had complied with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ('GAAP'). Beginning on January 22, 2004, Lattice began to issue press releases indicating that it had potentially overstated its deferred income account. Shares began to tumble in reaction to the news, falling from $12.36 on January 22, 2004 to close at $11.73 the following day. Shares traded as low as $10 the following week. Then on March 18, 2004, Lattice issued a press release indicating that it anticipated restating its first, second and third quarters of its 2003 financial statements as it had likely overstated the Company's Deferred Income Account, an account that represents the Company's judgment as to the potential gross margin on inventory held by the Company's distributors. On March 24, 2004, Lattice finally released its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. The restatement reduced 2003 revenue by approximately 7% over the nine-month period and increased the Company's net loss by an additional $9 million. In its March 24, 2004 press release the Company attributed the restatement to 'inappropriate accounting entries made, by an individual in the Company's finance department and deficiencies in the design and operation of internal accounting controls related to the deferred income account.' Shares of Lattice continued to sink, falling to $8.95 on April 19, 2004 when it finally amended its Form 10-Q, representing a decline of approximately 27.5% since the overstatement was first announced. NOTE: Lattice Semiconductor Corporation designs, develops and markets programmable logic devices (PLDs) and related software. PLDs are semiconductor components that can be configured by end customers as specific logic circuits and thus enable shorter design cycle times and reduced development costs.

The Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on February 3, 2006, and a hearing before the Court on this motion was held on May 22, 2006. On June 14, 2006, the Court denied the Company??s motion to dismiss and on July 25, 2006, the Court entered a scheduling order for further proceedings in the case. Discovery has commenced and is anticipated to continue into 2008. Several purported shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed against Martek and certain of its present and former executive officers charging the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. More specifically, the complaint alleges that the Company failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them: (1) that due to the Company's productions issues in the past, the defendants put in place a system by ",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose the true extent of MBIA's exposure to losses stemming from MBIA's insurance of residential mortgage-backed securities (""RMBS""), including in particular its exposure to so-called ""CDO-squared"" securities that are backed by RMBS. This highly risky exposure was belatedly disclosed in a series of public statements beginning on December 19, 2007 and ending on January 9, 2008, the last day of the Class Period. One analyst observed that MBIA had withheld from the public the riskiest parts of its insured portfolio, while others expressed similar dismay at MBIA's failure to apprise investors of these risks in a timely manner. The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and that [individual] Defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On July 07, 2008, in a Case Management Order, the Court determined that the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma is the most adequate plaintiff to represent the purchasers of MBIA securities.  The Court approved the law firm of Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger, and Grossman as the selection of this qualified counsel as lead for the consolidated action. The master file shall be Case No. 08-CV-264 (KMK). On October 17, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants.    On March 11, 2008, several motions to appoint lead plaintiff and to approve the selection of lead counsel were filed.  On March 31, 2010, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. Lead Plaintiff's claims against Dunton and Chaplin are dismissed without prejudice to amendment. Lead Plaintiff's claims against all Defendants regarding alleged misstatements or omissions involving control rights and payment obligations are also dismissed without prejudice. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss all other claims was denied. On September 21, 2011, a court??s order granted the lead plaintiff??s motion for preliminary approval for the proposed settlement. On September 30, 2011, the lead plaintiff??s entered a notice of voluntary dismissal pursuant to F.R.C.P. 41(a)(1) of the claims and allegations against the individual defendants.

The Complaint alleges that defendants falsely reported its financial results for fiscal year 1999, causing its stock price to rise to $89-3/4 during the Class Period. On April 29, 1999, McKesson HBOC disclosed that sales had been improperly recorded throughout fiscal year 1999, and the Company would have to restate its results. This stunning announcement caused McKesson's stock price to plunge to as low as $32 per share, closing at $34-1/2, a 47% one-day drop. On January 8, 2002 and on January 6, 2003, the district court, in separate orders, substantially upheld investors' claims against McKesson HBOC, HBOC, Arthur Andersen, Bear Stearns and certain top officers at McKesson and HBOC. In a separate proceeding, McKesson counter-sued the Common Retirement Fund and former HBOC shareholders, alleging that these investors were unjustly enriched when they received fully-valued McKesson shares in exchange for HBOC shares that were overvalued due to accounting improprieties at HBOC. The district court, however, dismissed the counter-claim.  On August 13, 2003, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the dismissal of McKesson's claims, essentially ending McKesson's attempts to hold shareholders individually liable for corporate acts which were neither known nor countenanced by them. According to the Ninth Circuit, McKesson has ""potential legal claims against any number of parties who, unlike the former shareholders, actually played a substantial role in the decision"" to merge with HBOC, including ""the phalanx of investment bankers, lawyers, auditors, accountants and other advisors associated with the transaction."" Moreover, ""the sanctity of the corporate entity, as well as the policies mitigating against subjecting individual shareholders of a public company to a liability for a merger gone bad, defeat McKesson's effort to turn corporate law inside out."" On January 12, 2005, McKesson Corporation announced that it reached an agreement to settle the consolidated securities class action arising out of a 1999 financial restatement pending against it and its subsidiary the former HBO & Co., Inc. in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. Under the agreement, McKesson would pay the class members a total of $960 million in cash. The combination of the class action settlement announced and the decision by the company to establish reserves for the remaining HBOC restatement litigation arising out of the Restatement and related matters will result in an aggregate charge for McKesson's third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004, of $1.2 billion pre-tax, $810 million after-tax, or approximately $2.70 per share. In a press release dated June 10, 2005, a $960 million settlement agreed upon by McKesson to resolve a shareholder lawsuit has been denied preliminary approval by a federal judge. U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Whyte objected to ""two nonmonetary provisions of the settlement,"" the San Francisco health care giant said in a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""We believe we will be able to address and resolve the court's issues, but this does create the possibility for delay in the payments,"" said Larry Kurtz, a McKesson spokesman.  In a press release dated October 26, 2005, a hearing will be held on January 27, 2006 at 9:00 a.m., before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte in the United States Courthouse, Courtroom 6, 4th Floor, 280 South First Street, San Jose, California 95113 for the purpose of determining: (1) whether the proposed settlement of the claims in the Litigation against McKesson, HBOC and Defendants' Released Persons for the sum of $960 million in cash, plus interest earned from 15 days after District Court Approval, should be approved as fair, reasonable and adequate to the Settlement Class, and whether an order should be entered dismissing on the merits and with prejudice the claims that are, or ever have been, asserted in the Litigation by Lead Plaintiff and the Settlement Class against McKesson, HBOC and Defendants' Released Persons who are, or have been, named as defendants in the Litigation (2) whether the Plan of Allocation is fair and equitable and therefore should be approved and (3) whether the application of Lead Counsel for the payment of attorneys' fees, reimbursement of expenses and interest thereon should be approved. In a press release dated December 14, 2005, McKesson Corp. said Bear Stearns Cos. sued to block a proposed $960 million settlement of investor lawsuits over the drug distributor's 1999 earnings restatement. Bear Stearns's complaint alleges the settlement in the U.S. District Court in Northern California breached an agreement between McKesson and the bank, the San Francisco-based drug wholesaler said Monday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The complaint was filed in New York. Bear Stearns's objections were earlier rebuffed by U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose, Calif., according to an order filed Sept. 8. The suit may only delay approval of the settlement, said Lisa Gill, a JP Morgan Securities Inc. analyst in New York. The accord, reached in January, must win final approval before payouts can begin, and a hearing is set for Jan. 27. The settlement would be the sixth-largest in U.S. history, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  According to the Companys FORM 8-K dated February 27, 2006, on February 24, 2006, in the previously disclosed consolidated securities class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. C99-20743 RMW (the Class Action), the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte signed a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal (the Judgment), as jointly requested by the Company and the Lead Plaintiff pursuant to the previously reported settlement of the Class Action. The Judgment finally approves the settlement and dismisses on the merits and with prejudice all claims asserted in the Class Action by the Lead Plaintiff against the Company, HBO & Company, and Defendants Released Persons (as that term is defined in the Judgment). As previously reported, the Settlement Amount is $960 million. Under the Judgment, interest will begin to accrue on the Settlement Amount on March 11, 2006, at the interest rate for 90-day United States Treasury bills on that date. The Judgment requires McKesson to pay the Settlement Amount plus any accrued interest not later than""7 days after the Effective Date, which is the first day following the date on which the Judgment is finally affirmed on appeal or is no longer subject to appeal, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement. If no appeal is filed, the first day on which McKesson could be required to pay the Settlement Amount will be April 3, 2006, although McKesson may elect to pay the Settlement Amount prior to that date. According to a press release dated February 21, 2007, the purpose of this Summary Notice is to inform you of a proposed Settlement and that a hearing will be held on April 13, 2007 at 9:00 a.m., before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte in the United States Courthouse, Courtroom 6, 4th Floor, 280 South First Street, San Jose, California 95113 for the purpose of determining: (1) whether the proposed Settlement of the claims in the Litigation against Arthur Andersen LLP (""AALLP"") for the sum of $72.5 million in cash, plus interest, plus certain contingent amounts, should be approved as fair, reasonable and adequate to the Settlement Class, and whether an order should be entered dismissing on the merits and with prejudice the claims that are, or ever have been, asserted in the Litigation by Lead Plaintiff and the Settlement Class against AALLP in the Litigation (2) whether the Plan of Allocation, previously approved by the Court on February 26, 2006 in connection with the previous settlement in this Litigation, is fair and equitable and therefore should be approved in connection with this Settlement and (3) whether the application of Lead Counsel for the payment of attorneys' fees, reimbursement of expenses and interest thereon should be approved.

The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys   business prospects. The complaint further alleges that defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (i) that Allscripts lacked the necessary resources to install V-11 software at customer sites (ii) that Allscripts had no historical basis to estimate the completion of V-11 or the impact V-11 sales might have on the Companys 2007 revenues and earnings (iii) that the complexity of V-11 had materially and adversely lengthened the sales cycle and revenue recognition cycle for the Companys V-11 sales contracts (iv) that Allscripts was currently experiencing adverse and continuing delays in the installation of V-11 software systems and (v) that based on the foregoing, defendants had no reasonable basis for their statements and opinions concerning Allscripts?? current and future financial performance and projections.

On February 22, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, which asserts claims for violations of Section 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the Company's option granting practices. On May 23, 2007, the parties in both this action and the state derivative actions discussed above participated in a mediation. As a result of this mediation, the parties in both actions reached a preliminary settlement understanding, which included corporate governance reforms and an amount to cover plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. The parties submitted the settlement agreement and related paperwork for the court's approval, which was obtained in December 2007. The monetary portion of the proposed settlement was covered by the Company's director and officer liability insurance. The original complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants misrepresented and omitted material facts concerning Meade's backdating of stock option grants to two of its officers.

MoneyGram, through its subsidiaries, provides payment services in the United States, as well as through a network of retail agents in North America, Latin America, western Europe, eastern Europe, Africa, India, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business and financial results related to its investments. As a result of defendants false statements, MoneyGram stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, trading in the 30 per share range during most of the Class Period. On January 14, 2008, the Company announced that it had completed a valuation of its investment portfolio and had experienced additional net unrealized losses of $571 million as of September 30, 2007, bringing its cumulative net unrealized losses to $860 million. In addition, the Company announced it had needed to obtain amendments and waivers under its credit agreements. On this news, MoneyGrams stock declined to as low as $5.66 per share before closing at $6.15 per share on January 15, 2008, on volume of 19 million shares, a one-day decline of 50%. Later, on March 25, 2008, the Company publicly disclosed that the SEC had launched an investigation into its financial statements, reporting and disclosures related to its investment portfolio. According to the complaint, the true facts, which were known by the defendants but concealed from the investing public during the Class Period, were as follows: (a) the Company lacked requisite internal controls to ensure that the reserves for the Companys investments in asset-backed securities were adequate, and, as a result, the Companys projections and reported results issued during the Class Period were based upon defective assumptions and/or manipulated facts and (b) the Company concealed the extent of its potential losses arising from its exposure to asset-backed securities containing uncollectible debt.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the class period Marsh failed to disclose that hundreds of millions of dollars of the Company's profits derive from illegal activities, namely ""contingent commissions,"" special payments received from insurance companies that were far beyond normal sales commissions. As alleged, these payments were compensation for the business that Marsh and its independent brokers steered and allocated to the insurance companies, distinguished by Marsh as compensation for ""market services."" Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Marsh occasionally solicited bogus bids, in order to mislead its customers into believing that true competition had taken place. Marsh allegedly did this while it asserted in public statements that its ""guiding principle"" was to always regard its client's best interests. The complaint also alleges that during the Class Period, statements made by the defendants were each materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and misrepresented the following adverse facts: (a) the Company had implemented and executed an unsustainable business practice whereby the Company designed and executed a business plan under which insurance companies agreed to pay so-called ""contingent commissions"" in return for Marsh to steer them business and shield them from competition (b) the defendants have described only that revenue attributable to MMC's risk and insurance business consists primarily of fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, interest income on funds held in a fiduciary capacity for others, and compensation for services provided in connection with the organization, structuring, and management of insurance. In particular, the defendants stated the revenue generated by MMC's risk and insurance business is fundamentally derived from the value of the service provided to clients and insurance markets. Although the defendants stated that commissions vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts, and negotiations with clients, the Company failed to disclose the kick-backs or the bid-rigging scheme (c) the Company's illicit scheme exposed the Company to significant regulatory penalties and threatened loss of consumer goodwill jeopardizing the Company's ability to sustain any performance in its legitimate business practices (d) the Company's revenues and earnings would have been significantly less had the Company not engaged in such unlawful practices. According to a press release dated July 25, 2006, Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York upheld a number of the plaintiffs' key claims against subsidiary Marsh Inc., its parent company Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC), former chief executive officer Jeffrey W. Greenberg and former president and chief operating officer Roger Egan. Claims against certain independent directors and auditor Deloitte & Touche were dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their culpability in the alleged activities, the judge wrote.  Kram said there was enough evidence that the broker and the two top executives were involved in manipulative or deceptive practices intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity. The executives, she noted, had direct control over other employees who allegedly engaged in bid-rigging.  The plaintiffs' claim that MMC submitted false and misleading statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission also was upheld.  The class-action suit against Marsh stems from a civil complaint that New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed against it alleging that the company ""steered unsuspecting clients to insurers with whom it had lucrative payoff agreements."" In January 2005, Marsh agreed to establish a fund of $850 million as part of a settlement with Spitzer and the New York State Insurance Department.  On October 13, 2006, a Second Amended Complaint was filed by the plaintiffs.  A Third Amended Complaint was filed, and on May 14, 2007 defendants responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint. According to the Decision of Interest dated November 21, 2007, on March 13, 2007, Plaintiff M.F. Henry ('Henry') filed a Third Amended Complaint (the 'TAC') alleging that corporate defendant Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ('MMC' or the 'Company'), as well as various MMC directors (the 'Director Defendants') violated section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Securities & Exchange Commission ('SEC') Rule 14a-9. The defendants have moved for dismissal pursuant to principles of res judicata, Rules 12 (b) (6) and 9 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('PSLRA'). The Court grants the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion and dismisses the TAC with prejudice. On December 13, 2007, a Notice of Appeal was filed as to the Memorandum and Opinion dismissing the Third Amended Complaint with prejudice. On March 19, 2008, the appeal was dismissed with prejudice.  On September 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class.  On November 13, 2009, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement. According to an article dated November 13, 2009, Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. will pay $435 million to settle securities and ERISA class actions filed against the brokerage in 2004, New York-based MMC said. The suits were filed against MMC after its stock plummeted from $45 to about $23 after former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed charges against MMC alleging bid-rigging and client-steering at its brokerage unit. MMC settled those charges in 2005 for $850 million. The latest settlements, which are subject to court approval, resolve all claims against MMC, Marsh Inc. and named individuals resulting from the securities and Employee Retirement Income Security Act suits, according to an MMC statement. Under the terms of one settlement, MMC will pay $400 million to settle the securities class action suit brought by Ohio and New Jersey on behalf of public pension plans in those states. $205 million of the settlement will be covered by insurance, MMC said. Separately, MMC will pay $35 million to settle an ERISA class action brought by participants and beneficiaries of an MMC retirement plan. $25 million of that amount will be covered by insurance, MMC said.  In a statement, MMC ... admitted no wrongdoing. On December 7, 2009, Judge Colleen McMahon preliminarily approved the settlement. A Settlement Fairness Hearing was set for December 23, 2009, to determine if the final settlement should be approved.  On December 23, 2009, Judge Colleen McMahon signed the Decision and Order approving the settlement, certifying the class for settlement purposes, approving the plan of allocation of the settlement fund, awarding attorneys' fees, and rejecting the objections.   According to the Order, the Court (1) approves the Settlement (2) grants Lead Counsel's Fee Application of 13.5% of the Settlement Fund (3) grants Lead Counsel's request for reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $7,848,411.84 and (4) grants Lead Plaintiff's' PSLRA Award Request for expenses totaling $214,657.14 ($70,000 for the Ohio Plaintiff's and $144,657.14 for the New Jersey Plaintiffs).

The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and prospects for AFREZZA. Specifically, defendants continuously hyped AFREZZA for the treatment of adult patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes for the control of hyperglycemia, telling market observers that AFREZZA was one of the most valuable products in the history of drug making, while failing to disclose that MannKind's platform would require better information for patients about the risks of AFREZZA. As a result of defendants' false and misleading statements, MannKind's stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.    Then, on January 19, 2011, shortly before the market closed, MannKind issued a press release announcing that the Company had received a complete response letter from the FDA pertaining to the Company's New Drug Application for AFREZZA. The FDA deferred approving AFREZZA and requested two additional clinical trials with the inhaler. Prior to this news being released on January 19, 2011, MannKind's stock began dropping as news of the FDA deferral leaked into the market. The complaint alleges that, in fact, the FDA notice had been received on January 18, 2011, and defendants had held off informing shareholders. Trading was halted in MannKind stock on January 19, 2011, and when trading resumed the next day, MannKind's stock plunged $2.94 per share. According to the Minutes entered on April 28, 2011, the Court appoints Choi as lead plaintiff and Pomerantz Haudek Gossman & Gross LLP and Glancy Binkow & Goldber LLP as co-lead counsel. The lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint on June 27, 2011, and corrected the complaint on June 28, 2011.  On August 12, 2011, the defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the case.  The motion was denied on December 16, 2011. On May 25, 2012, the Court issued an Order Granting Stipulation To Stay Action Post Mediation. On August 6, 2012, a Stipulation of Settlement was entered into the Court's docket.  On September 12, 2012, the Court issued an Order preliminarily approving the class action settlement.   On December 21, 2012, the Court issued an Order on the Motions for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement, Award of Attorney Fees, and Reimbursement of Expenses.

On March 1, 2007 the judge entered his Final Order awarding attorneys' fees and expenses while terminating the case.  The settlement provides a $10.5 million fund, plus interest, to be paid to qualifying class members.  Counsel was awarded 30% of the gross settlement in addition to roughly $200,000 of expense reimbursement.   According to the Companys FORM 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, between March 2, 2005 and April 22, 2005, seven separate complaints were filed, each purporting to be on behalf of a class of Molex shareholders, against the Company, and certain of its officers and employees. The shareholder actions have been consolidated before Judge Ruben Castillo in a case pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division entitled The Takara Trust v. Molex Incorporated, et. al., Case No. 05C 1245. The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges, among other things, that during the period from July 27, 2004 to February 14, 2005, the named defendants made or caused to be made a series of materially false or misleading statements about Molexs business, prospects, operations, and financial statements which constituted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that certain of the named defendants engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. As relief, the complaint seeks, among other things, a declaration that the action be certified as a proper class action, unspecified compensatory damages (including interest) and payment of costs and expenses (including fees for legal counsel and experts). ?? On April 28, 2006, the Court denied defendants?? motion to dismiss the complaint. On July 6, 2005, the Court appointed City of Pontiac Group, Joan L. Weeks individually and as trustee, and James Baker as lead plaintiffs, and approved lead plaintiffs?? choice of lead counsel. On June 15, 2006, defendants answered the complaint, denying any liability to plaintiffs and asserting numerous defenses. Discovery is ongoing, and is scheduled to conclude in March 2007. The original complaint alleges that the Company failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly""regarded by them: (1) that the Company hid $5.8 million in inventory expenses in order to inflate its earnings (2) that as a result the foregoing Molex had to take an $9.1 million inventory charge (3) that, in addition to hiding inventory expenses, the Company improperly accounted for its accrual for vacation pay, its recording of a contingent gain, and its recording of the first quarter profit-in-inventory charge (4) that the Company's financial results were in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") (5) that the Company lacked adequate internal controls and (6) that as a result of the above, the Company's financial results were materially inflated at all relevant times. The complaint further alleges that on or around November 11, 2004, Molex announced that it was delaying the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 and that its Chief Financial Officer had been replaced. The Company also revealed that it identified certain improper accounting practices. On November 15, 2004, Molex issued a press relea",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

The Company has now said that its financial statements from June of 2000 to the present cannot be relied upon, and that it will be restating financial results. The practice of manipulating stock option dates not only potentially lines the pockets of the executives, but here resulted in the overstatement of Marvell's earnings during the Class Period, and the under-booking of compensation expenses. Under accounting rules, back-dating an option grant is deemed the payment of additional compensation and must be accounted for as an expense, which Marvell failed to do. The complaint further alleges that on or around October 3, 2006, the defendants announced that the Company would be forced to restate its financial statements to correct for the backdating of stock options. From the time that assertions were first made in the press that Marvell's options practices might be questionable to the date of this announcement, Marvell stock sank from over $28 per share to roughly $16 per share. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 3, 2008, between October 5, 2006 and November 13, 2006, four putative class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. The complaints allege that the Company and certain of its officers and directors violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements and omissions relating to the grants of stock options. The complaints seek, on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys common shares during the period from October 3, 2001 to October 3, 2006, unspecified damages, interest, and costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements. Pursuant to an order of the court dated February 2, 2007, these four putative class actions were consolidated as a single action entitled In re Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Securities Litigation. On August 16, 2007, plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. On October 18, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint. The motion is fully briefed and was argued on February 15, 2008. On September 29, 2008, Judge Ronald M. Whyte issued an Order on the defendants?? various motions to dismiss. According to the Order, the Judge Whyte granted in part and denied in part three of the defendants?? motions to dismiss, and granted one of the individual defendant??s motion to dismiss.   According to a press release dated June 9, 2009, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: MRVL), a world leader in storage, communications and consumer silicon solutions, today announced that it had entered into an agreement to resolve a shareholder class action lawsuit filed on August 16, 2007 against Marvell and certain of its former and current officers and directors relating to Marvell's historic stock option granting practices.

The restatement is necessary because Medicis applied an improper accounting method in determining reserves for sales returns during the Class Period.  News of the pending restatement caused Medicis' stock price to fall significantly, damaging investors.

Sprizzo) ruled yesterday to approve a $30 million settlement for shareholders of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (MSO) who purchased MSO common stock between January 8, 2002 and October 2, 2002. The action, In re Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. Securities Litigation, alleged that Martha Stewart, MSO and other MSO company executives misled investors by issuing a number of materially false and misleading statements regarding the risks to MSO and to its company brand as a result of damage to Martha Stewart's reputation stemming from the government's investigation into her December 27, 2001 sale of ImClone Systems, Inc. common stock. This settlement was unique in that Martha Stewart personally contributed $5 million of her own funds towards the $30 million settlement fund. The settlement represents a significant portion of class members' estimated damages arising from defendants' alleged wrongful conduct. According to a press release dated November 8, 2006, Martha Stewart will pay $5 million to settle a class action lawsuit related to her securities -fraud trial, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. said Wednesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Martha Stewart Living plans to pay roughly $15 million of the $30 million total, and the company expects its insurers to pay about $10 million. The New York-based company said last month it recorded an $18.2 million litigation-reserve charge to cover the costs of settling the lawsuit. Stewart was convicted in March 2004 on four charges of obstructing justice and lying to prosecutors in connection with her sale of ImClone Systems Inc. Earlier this year, Stewart settled civil insider-trading charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to $195,000 in fines, a five-year ban on serving as a director of a public company. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, on May 19, 2003, the Companys motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint was denied. The matter remains pending, and discovery is ongoing.  As summarized by the same SEC filing, on February 3, 2003, the Company was named as a defendant in a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (the Consolidated Class Action Complaint), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, by plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased common stock in the Company between January 8, 2002 and October 2, 2002. In re Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. Securities Litigation, 02-CV-6273 (JES). The Consolidated Class Action Complaint also names Martha Stewart and seven of the Companys other present or former officers (Gregory R. Blatt, Sharon L. Patrick, and five other Company officers) as defendants. All such individuals other than Martha Stewart are collectively referred to herein as the Individual Defendants.?? The action consolidated seven class actions previously filed in the Southern District of New York. The claims in the Consolidated Class Action Complaint arise out of Ms. Stewart??s sale of 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems stock on December 27, 2001. The plaintiffs assert violations of Sections 10(b) (and rules promulgated thereunder), 20(a) and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs allege that MSO, Ms. Stewart and the Individual Defendants omitted material information and made statements about Ms. Stewart??s sale that were materially false and misleading. The plaintiffs allege that, as a result of these false and misleading statements, the market price of the Company??s stock was inflated during the putative class periods and dropped after the alleged falsity of the statements became public. The plaintiffs further alleged that the Individual Defendants traded MSO stock while in possession""aterial non-public information, but as explained below, all such allegations have been dismissed. The Consolidated Class Action Complaint seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys?? fees and costs, and furt""r relief as determined by the court. By stipulation of the parties, and an order of the court entered November 10, 2003, all claims asserted in the Consolidated Class Action Complaint pursuant to Section 20A (Insider Trading) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants, and all remaining claims against the Individual Defendants, other than Mr. Blatt and Ms. Patrick, were dismissed without prejudice.  The original complaint charges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market between January 8, 2002 and July 24, 2002. Among other things, the complaint alleges that Stewart sold 100% of her personally held common stock of ImClone, Inc. (""ImClone"") based on insider information obtained from Samuel Waksal   (""Waksal""), ImClone's CEO and a personal friend of Stewart's.

According to a press release dated June 27, 2005, Micromuse Inc. said that it has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to settle a securities class action lawsuit against it and a number of current and former officers, as well as a related federal shareholder derivative lawsuit. The cases were related to its restated financial reports filed May 17. The software provider said the payment will have no material adverse financial impact and will be covered largely by its insurers. Micromuse said none of the parties connected with the lawsuits admitted liability and that it didn't make any admission of wrongdoing. The settlement must receive court approvals, said Micromuse. As summarized by the Companys FORM 10-K For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004, between January 12, 2004 and March 5, 2004, seven securities class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. In July 2004, the District Court consolidated the various actions, named Massachusetts Laborers Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and appointed the law firm of Berman, DeValerio, Pease, Tabacco, Burt & Pucillo as lead plaintiffs counsel. In September 2004, lead plaintiff Massachusetts Laborers Pension Fund filed a consolidated amended complaint on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the Companys common stock. The alleged class period is January 18, 2001 through May 18, 2004. The consolidated amended complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and asserts causes of action for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, arising out of the Company??s restatement of its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2001 and 2002 and for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 through June 30, 2003, and the Company??s adjustment of its preliminary consolidated financial statement information for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, as initially announced on October 29, 2003, and the Company??s adjustment of preliminary financial information for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, as announced on February 10, 2004. On November 8, 2004, the Company and the other defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

The court awarded attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of 23.5% and $229,847.79, respectively. According to a press release dated March 11, 2008, Nash Finch Company a leading national food distributor, announced that it has signed a Stipulation of Settlement which, if approved by the Court, will fully resolve all of the claims in the putative securities fraud class action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. That class action was filed after the Company issued revised earnings guidance on October 20, 2005. The lawsuit challenged, among other things, the public statements the Company made about its acquisition of certain assets from Roundys Supermarkets, Inc. The Company denies it engaged in any wrongdoing. Pursuant to this settlement, which is subject to certain conditions, $6.75 million will be paid into a settlement fund that will be distributed to members of a class of all persons who purchased the Companys common stock from February 24, 2005, the date the Company announced an agreement to acquire certain assets from Roundys Supermarkets, Inc., through and including October 20, 2005, the date the Company announced a downward revision to its earnings guidance for fiscal 2005. The settlement payment will be funded in full by the Companys insurance coverage. Notice of the settlement must be provided to the class and then it is subject to final approval by the Court. As summarized by the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended: December 29, 2007, on December 19, 2005 and January 4, 2006, two purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota on behalf of purchasers of Nash Finch common stock during the period from February 24, 2005, the date we announced an agreement to acquire two distribution divisions from Roundys, through October 20, 2005, the date we announced a downward revision to our earnings outlook for fiscal 2005. One of the complaints was voluntarily dismissed on March 3, 2006 and a consolidated complaint was filed on June 30, 2006. The consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing false statements regarding, among other things, the integration of the distribution divisions acquired from Roundys, the performance of our core businesses, our internal controls and our financial projections, so as to artificially inflate the price of our common stock. The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, which the Court denied on May 1, 2007.  Following the denial of the Motion to Dismiss, Nash Finch and the purported class engaged in settlement discussions which are still ongoing. The original Complaint alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false statements in the summer of 2004, which included eliminating non-performing assets, restructuring the Company's credit lines, and issuing hundreds of millions of dollars in then-unregistered convertible debt. Also, the complaint alleges that on February 24, 2005, the inception of the Class Period, defendants announced a $220 million acquisition of Roundy's Distribution Center (Roundy's), a Midwest food distributor, which, according to defendants, was expected to add nearly $1 billion in yearly sales to the Company, be immediately accretive to ear""ings, and create approximately $10 million per year in cost savings. Unbeknownst to investors, however, defendants' statements were materially false and misleading because defendants knew, or recklessly disregarded. Throughout the Class Period, defendants failed to disclose that (i) the Company was operating far below expectations (ii) that the Company had significantly under-reserved for the Roundy's acquisition (iii) the integration of Roundy's was not proceeding according to plan and (iv) Nash Finch's core business was underperforming guidance. While investors were unaware of the conditions that were adversely affecting Nash Finch, defendants sold more than $300 million in notes in a private placement and Company insiders sold more than $17 million of their Nash Finch shares. On October 20, 2005, the last day of the Class Period, the Company issued a press release announcing significantly lower fiscal 2005 earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.25 per share, from its previous guidance of $3.70 and $3.89. The Company attributed the lowered guidance to ""a decline in retail gross profit margins, primarily reflecting inadequate execution in pricing across the Company's retail operations depressed wholesale gross profit margins principally relating to manufacturer promotional spending and higher than expected acquisition integration costs.""

Further, the Court authorizes reimbursement of expenses of $2,000 for plaintiff class representatives: Joseph Boodaie and Samuel Toovey. On September 20, 2006, a Stipulation of Settlement was filed. As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended December 31, 2005, on June 15, 2004, three plaintiffs, Joseph Boodaie, Morgan Boodaie and Samuel Toovy, were designated lead plaintiffs pursuant to the Private Securities Class Action Reform Act (PSLRA), and filed a consolidated amended complaint that superseded the various complaints originally filed and contained an expanded class period. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in particular by failing to satisfy the pleading standards of PSLRA. By order dated March 30, 2005, the Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss, and granted the plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on April 29, 2005. The defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint as well. That motion is fully briefed. On June 16, 2004, another alleged shareholder, Paul Doherty, filed a shareholder derivative suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court, repeating the allegations of the Harkness complaint and demanding, purportedly on behalf of the Company, damages and other relief against certain of the Company's executive officers and directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary and other duties. This action was stayed pending resolution of the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in the putative class action. On or about January 24, 2006, the Company, the Companys insurer and plaintiffs counsel in both the federal securities class action and in the state derivative class action verbally agreed to settle these matters on the following key deal terms: The Companys insurer would pay $2,062,500 in settlement of the putative class action, with the Company to pay an equal sum the Companys insurer would pay $87,500 in settlement of the state derivative class action, with the Company to pay an equal sum and the class action period would be extended though and including September 21, 2005. The parties are presently working on documenting their agreement in a comprehensive written settlement agreement. To date, such an agreement has not been executed, nor have the parties obtained preliminary or final class approval from the Court. The Company established reserves for this matter at March 31, 2005 of $2.2 million.

More specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Company failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them: (1) that the Company underestimated competition when it opened stores in Texas (2) that as a result of this, the Company failed to implement a more flexible pricing strategy in its Texas stores that would have achieved ""growth"" for the Co",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

In September 2007, the first action originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  Specifically, the complaint charges Netlist, its underwriters, and certain of the Company's officers and directors with including, or allowing the inclusion of, materially false and misleading statements in the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The Complaint charges defendants with failing to conduct an adequate due diligence investigation into the Company prior to the IPO. In particular, the Complaint charges defendants with failing to reveal to shareholders, at the time of the IPO, that Netlist was already witnessing adverse effects of an oversaturated computer memory market. This, despite the fact that defendants knew or should have known that the Company had no strategy to allow it to minimize adverse market conditions, contrary to prior representations in road-show presentations to analysts and investors prior to the IPO, and media interviews immediately following the IPO. On April 16, 2007, after the close of trading, the truth about Netlist was revealed, including the fact that the problems which existed at the time of the IPO would result in extremely disappointing results for the first quarter of 2007. Defendants admitted that the Company was performing well below guidance, that earnings would be almost 75% lower than previous forecasts, and that expenses were higher than expected. This, after defendants and other Company insiders liquidated over $6.5625 million of their personally held shares in connection with the IPO. The complaint further alleges that as a result of this news, Netlist's stock price collapsed the following trading day. Shares of Netlist fell almost 30% in a single trading day on huge volume of 1.783 million shares -- falling to approximately $4.29 per share -- and amounting to a decline of almost 40% compared to the November 2006 IPO Offering price, and a decline of almost 70% compared to Netlist's trading period high of more than $12.00 per share. As summarized by the Company??s FORM 10-K or the fiscal year ended January 2, 2010, beginning in May 2007, the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and the Company's underwriters were named as defendants in four purported class action shareholder complaints, two of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and two of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. These purported class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock pursuant or traceable to the Company's November 30, 2006 initial public offering (the ""PO""). The lawsuits were consolidated into a single action??Belodoff v. Netlist, Inc., Lead Case No. SACV07-677 DOC (MLGx)??which is currently pending in the Central District of California. Lead Plaintiff filed the Consolidated Complaint in November 2007. Defendants filed their motions to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in January 2008. The motions to dismiss were taken under submission in April 2008 and on May 30, 2008, the court granted the defendants' motions. However, plaintiffs were granted the right to amend their complaint and subsequently filed their First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""ended Complaint"") in July 2008. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint in January 2009, and on April 17, 2009, the court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. However, plaintiffs were again granted the right to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs' filed their Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""Second Amended Complaint"") in May 2009. Generally, the Second Amended Complaint, like the preceding complaints, alleged that the Registration Statement filed by the Company in connection with the IPO contained untrue statements of material fact or omissions of material fact in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of Securities Act of 1933. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in June 2009. The motions to dismiss were taken under submission in August 2009 and on September 1, 2009, the Court granted the defendants' motions. However, plaintiffs again were granted the right to amend their complaint. In October 2009, following a voluntary mediation of the matter, which took place in December 2008, and subsequent good-faith settlement negotiations, the parties reached a tentative agreement in principle to settle the class action. In February 2010, the parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement documenting the essential terms of the proposed settlement, informed the court of their proposed settlement, and currently are drafting a joint motion to submit to the court for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. Under the settlement agreement to be presented to the court for approval, plaintiffs and the class will dismiss all claims, with prejudice, in exchange for a cash payment of $2.6 million. The Company's directors' and officers' liability insurers will pay the settlement amount in accordance with the Company's insurance policies. The court, upon the parties' stipulation, has stayed all proceedings in the action, except as necessary to consummate the proposed settlement.  According to a press release dated May 6, 2010, pursuant to an Order of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, that a hearing will be held on September 30, 2010, at 8:30 a.m., before the Honorable David O. Carter, United States District Judge, at the United States District Court, Central District of California, Southern Division, Ronald Reagan Federal Building and United States Courthouse, 411 West Fourth Street, Santa Ana, California 92701, for the purpose of determining: (1) whether the proposed settlement of the claims in the Litigation against the Defendants for the sum of $2,600,000 in cash, plus accrued interest, should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate (2) whether, thereafter, this Litigation should be dismissed with prejudice as set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement dated February 16, 2010 (the ""Stipulation"") (3) whether the Plan of Allocation is fair, reasonable, and adequate and therefore should be approved and (4) whether the application of Lead Counsel for the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Litigation should be approved.Streen",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell granted final approval to the settlement Thursday. Novell, a networking software and Linux distribution firm that originated in Utah but relocated its headquarters to Waltham, Mass., last year, continued to deny all claims by plaintiffs Domenico Pirraglia, Bella and Bernard Pasternak and other shareholders. But it said its attorneys had concluded further litigation would be protracted and expensive and payment of the settlement was justified given the uncertainty and risk of such a complex case On February 7, 2005, the Court entered the Stipulation for settlement.  On February 24, 2005, the Court entered the Order by U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell, preliminarily approving the settlement.  A hearing on the Final Approval of settlement is set for May 26, 2005. As reported in Novells Form 10-K For the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2003, after a first dismissal of the suit on November 3, 2000 and a subsequent amendment to the complaint filed on February 20, 2001, the U.S. District Court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim. Much of the District Courts Order of Dismissal was recently affirmed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals while certain claims were remanded for the District Courts further review.  On December 6, 1999, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel issued an Order transferring the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. The complaint alleges the defendants, Novell and its top officers and directors and Novell's outside auditor and accounting firm, engaged in a fraudulent scheme and course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of Novell stock. Novell sells computer software products for use by business enterprises.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that during 95-96, Novell's business became very troubled due to the failure of several acquisitions it had made and the weakening of its competitive position as its products lost ground in the marketplace. Novell's revenues stagnated and/or declined, it lost several top executives and accumulated huge amounts of excessive inventories in its distribution channels. Due to these problems and the resulting doubts over Novell's continuing ability to achieve revenue an"" earnings per share (""EPS"") growth, Novell's stock was a very poor performer, declining from $23-$24 in 95 to less than $15 per share in early 96, notwithstanding the strong overall advance of stocks -- especially technology stocks -- over this time period. During its 2ndQ F96 ended 4/27/96, Novell suffered a large revenue decline and a loss, as it had to completely cease shipping product into its indirect distribution channels to try to ""clean out"" the ""boxed software"" in its channel. However, it assured investors that this extraordinary step would eliminate Novell's excessive channel inventories of ""boxed software"" and result in stronger and more predictable revenue and EPS growth for Novell going forward. However, when Novell's 3rdQ F96, ended 7/27/96, revenues and EPS continued to show declines, analysts and Novell stockholders were furious over this continued poor performance of Novell and, as a result, its stock continued to fall, ultimately reaching an all-time low of $8-3/4 per share.  In order to conceal the serious problems with Novell's business and thus support and artificially inflate Novell's stock price, Novell's insiders concealed the true nature and extent of the problems which were adversely impacting Novell's business and affirmatively misrepresented the success and state of demand for Novell's products and its prospects for revenue and EPS growth during F97. Defendants manipulated and inflated Novell's reported EPS for the 4thQ of F96, ended 10/26/96, and the 1stQ of F97, ended 1/31/97, making Novell appear profitable when, in fact, it had suffered losses. Novell improperly and prematurely recognized revenue on shipments of products into its distribution channel and dumped millions of dollars worth of product on the gray market. Novell also failed to record required losses for future product returns and uncollectible accounts receivables which they knew would occur as a result of their improper accounting practices. By these financial manipulations, Novell exceeded its 4thQ F96 forecasted EPS ""numbers"" and was able to show the quarter-over-quarter revenue and EPS growth it had forecasted and to report 1stQ F97 revenues and EPS of $375 million and $.15, respectively. The complaint further alleges that on or around 3/18/97, Novell announced that Eric Schmidt had been named Chairman of Novell's Board and its Chief Executive Officer. Then, on 4/22/97, just weeks after Schmidt joined Novell, Novell revealed that its 2ndQ F97 results -- the quarter to end 4/30/97 -- would be much worse than earlier forecast, with revenues of only about $300 million, a sharp decline from 1stQ F97 revenues of $375 million, due to poor sales to Novell's OEMs and distributors of boxed software products. Schmidt stated he would make the changes needed to better manage and control Novell's business -- especially product inventories in the distribution channel! Upon this revelation, which one analyst called ""brutal"" and ""not pretty,"" on 4/23/97, Novell's stock fell to $7 on huge volume of 1",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

NPS engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecules and recombinant proteins. Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and prospects, including the potential for success of PREOS, its full-length human parathyroid hormone (PTH) drug candidate being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis. As a result of these false statements, NPS stock traded at inflated levels during the Class Period, whereby the Company was able to sell 7 million shares of NPS stock for proceeds of more than $79 million. According to the complaint, the true facts, which were known by each of the defendants but concealed from the investing public during the Class Period, were as follows: (a) contrary to defendants' positive claims concerning the PaTH study on August 10, 2005, the results in fact evidenced that PREOS was no different from Fosamax in bone density and fracture results (b) there was a very narrow market for PTH drugs (like PREOS and its competitor Forteo): namely, patients with severe spinal osteoporosis who had also suffered a fracture (c) on or before August 2, 2005, defendants were notified that a major study performed by a lead researcher in the field who had reviewed all PREOS study results had concluded that further studies were necessary to determine the efficiency of PREOS, if any, in humans (d) unlike other bone density drugs/products which can be used for hip fracture risk reduction, PREOS, assuming it received FDA approval, could not be prescribed for this use - a key market for bone density drugs (e) the Center of Medicare Services of Health and Human Services had ruled that injectable drugs for osteoporosis, like PREOS's competitor Forteo, would be reimbursable only for patients who had suffered a fracture, which indicated that the market for a drug like PREOS was limited to a small subgroup of osteoporosis patients who had suffered a fracture while on an existing oral drug (f) defendants were also aware that physicians would never recommend PREOS except in all but the rarest cases, since the Physician Desk Reference on drugs recommended Forteo (and hence, injectable parathormone drugs like PREOS also) for second line use in osteoporosis after failure of oral drugs like Fosamax and for a maximum of 24 months, which limitations on physician use narrow the medical indication for parathormone drugs like PREOS and (g) the combination of these facts added up to a huge hurdle to market success for PREOS because the very drug that was the baseline precursor drug for osteoporosis, Fosamax, had already been shown to be as effective as PREOS in the PaTH studies. These facts about PREOS, including the limited reimbursement for the family of parathormone drugs, were critical to understanding the very difficult prospects for FDA approval and market success for the drug. On July 12, 2006, the plaintiff filed a Corrected Class Action Complaint.  On September 18, 2006, the Court entered the Order granting the motion to consolidate the cases.  According to the Order, the caption of the consolidated cases shall be In re NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

On November 17, 2006, the Court entered the Memorandum Decision and Order Appointing Lead Plaintiff and Approving Lead Plaintiff's Selection of Counsel.  On January 16, 2007, a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed.  On March 19, 2007, the Defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On July 3, 2007, Judge Paul G. Cassell denied the motion.   On November 1, 2007, lead plaintiff filed its motion to certify the class of shareholders that it seeks to represent in the action.  On March 21, 2008 the case was stayed pending mediation between the parties.  On February 24, 2009, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement finalizing the terms of the settlement, subject to final court approvals following notices to shareholders and members of the settlement class. On March 12, 2009, the court issued the Order granting the plaintiffs motion for certification and Preliminary Order approving the Stipulation of Settlement.

According to a press release dated April 13, 2007, Newpark Resources, Inc. announced today that it has reached settlements with the plaintiffs in shareholder class action and derivative litigation. As in all shareholder class and derivative actions, the settlement is subject to court approval. Once approved, the settlements will resolve all class and derivative litigation against the Company, its former and current directors, and former officers. During 2006, several securities class action lawsuits and derivative actions were filed against the Company, certain current and former directors, and former officers of the Company. These actions were commenced following the Company's disclosure of an internal investigation into potential irregularities in the processing and payment of invoices at one of its subsidiaries, Soloco Texas, LP (""Soloco""), and alleged improper granting, recording and accounting of backdated grants of stock options to executives. Newpark Resources, Inc. Under the terms of the settlement, Newpark will pay $1,550,000, and the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance carrier will pay $8,300,000. Both amounts include the cost of certain legal fees and administration costs. As part of the settlement, the Company is preserving certain claims it may have against its former CEO and CFO for matters arising from the potential invoicing irregularities at Soloco and the backdating of options. Newpark will accrue its share of the settlement costs, along with the legal fees incurred to conclude this settlement, in the first quarter of 2007. As summarized by the Companys FORM 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, between April 21, 2006 and May 9, 2006, five lawsuits asserting claims against us for violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5 were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. All five lawsuits have been transferred to Judge Marcel Livaudais who has consolidated these actions as In re: Newpark Resources, Inc. Securities Litigation. Following the filing of the Amendment No. 2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for 2005 (filed on October 10, 2006), the plaintiffs filed (on November 9, 2006) a Consolidated Class Action Complaint for Securities Fraud (the Consolidated Class Complaint) against us and [certain] directors and officers. The Consolidated Class Complaint alleges that we and the individual defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. These allegations arise from our disclosure of an internal investigation into potential irregularities in the processing and payment of invoices at one of our subsidiaries, Soloco Texas, LP, and alleged improper granting, recording and accounting of backdated grants of our stock options to our executives. The Consolidated Class Complaint does not specify the damages sought by the Plaintiffs and no discovery has been conducted to date.  The original Complaint charges Newpark and certain of the Company's executive officers with violations of federal securities laws. Among other things, plaintiff claims that defendants' material omissions and dissemination of materially false and misleading statements concerning Newpark's business and operations caused the Company's stock price to become artificially inflated, inflicting damages on investors. Newpark provides fluids management, environmental, and oilfield services, including drilling fluids sales, engineering services and onsite drilling fluids processing services, to the oil and gas exploration and production industry. The Complaint alleges that defendants' Class Period representations regarding Newpark were materially false and misleading when made because the Company failed to disclose irregularities with the processing and payment of invoices by the Company's subsidiary, Soloco Texas, LP. As a result, defendants' Class Period statements concerning Newpark's operations and financial performance were materially false and misleading. The complaint further alleges that on or around April 17, 2006, Newpark issued a press release announcing a Company investigation into the processing and payment of invoices at Soloco Texas, LP, and that Newpark's CFO and former CEO had been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigation.

Northwest Pipe manufactures and markets large-diameter, high pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications, primarily related to drinking water systems. Its pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems, wastewater systems and other applications. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and financial results. Specifically, the Complaint alleges the defendants overstated the Company's revenues and earnings by failing to recognize revenues in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

On February 6, 2008, just weeks after its IPO, Orion revealed news concerning the Company which completely surprised analysts and investors, and caused the stock to drop approximately 43%, to a price of $8.51 per share. Orion is a manufacturer of efficient lighting and energy systems to businesses. The Prospectus for its IPO described a Company that was quickly growing revenues from existing product lines, and briefly described product line extensions. After the close of trading on February 6, 2008, Orion revealed that revenues in its current fiscal quarter would decline as the Company took aggressive measures to promote a ``new business model,'' a change in focus that is alleged not to have been adequately disclosed or described in the IPO Prospectus. During the February 6, 2008 conference call, Orion executives, including the CEO, appeared unable to explain to the satisfaction of securities analysts this surprising news about the business model change on the heels of the IPO, or its impact on revenues. The complaint charges Orion, certain of its officers and directors and the underwriters who sponsored the IPO with violation of the federal securities laws by issuing a Registration Statement and Prospectus in connection with the IPO which was materially false or misleading due to omissions. The law generally imposes strict liability on defendants responsible for a materially false Registration Statement and Prospectus, including for purchases made in the open market after the IPO no fraud need be proved to recover. According to the Companys FORM 10-Q For the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2009, in February and March 2008, three class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, several of its officers, all members of its then existing board of directors, and certain underwriters relating to the Companys December 2007 initial public offering (IPO). The plaintiffs claim to represent those persons who purchased shares of the Companys common stock from December 18, 2007 through February 6, 2008. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants made misstatements and failed to disclose material information in the Companys IPO registration statement and prospectus. The complaints allege various claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The complaints seek, among other relief, class certification, unspecified damages, fees, and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper.  On August 1, 2008, the court-appointed lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On September 15, 2008, the Company and the other director and officer defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and the underwriters filed a separate motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on January 16, 2009.

According to the Complaint, on or about February 14, 2007 the Opnext commenced its IPO priced at $15.00 per share for over 16 million shares of stock. The Complaint asserts that Opnext's Registration Statement was materially false because: (i) the Company's reported net income for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2007 was overstated and (ii) the Company's reported net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was understated. The Complaint further alleges that on February 13, 2008 the Company announced, among other things, the Company's previously issued financial statements could no longer be relied upon and that it had to restate them.

Specifically, it is alleged that defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was improperly continuing to capitalize costs for individual projects after Ormat had decided to abandon further exploration and development of individual projects instead of expensing those costs in the period in which any such determination was made (2) that, as a result, the Companys financial results were overstated during the Class Period (3) that the Companys financial results were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) (4) that the Company lacked adequate internal and financial controls and (5), as a result of the above, that the Companys financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

The settlement covers the class as certified, is expected "" be paid by insurance, and is subject to court approval and potential appeal. Defendants have not yet filed an opposition to the motion for reconsideration as a result of the agreement regarding settlement. On or about October 31, 2006, the parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. In a press release dated October 5, 2006, on 28 September 2006, the Honorable Judge Young denied class certification for a proposed shareholder class during a ""disputed period"" in the PolyMedica Securities Litigation. This case was closely watched by the securities bar, as it had previously been sent to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued a ruling differentiating ""informational efficiency"" from ""fundamental efficiency"" and remanding the case to the district court. In applying the new standards, the district court agreed with the conclusion presented by NERA Senior Vice President Dr. Frederick Dunbar that one of the key arguments by the plaintiffs' expert in favor of information efficiency -- that the stock price responded to news -- was fundamentally flawed because the plaintiffs' expert only looked at selected days with large stock price movements rather than making a comparison of price movements on days with news and days without news. The district court further credited Dr. Dunbar's testimony that the high cost of short selling, violations of put-call parity, and serial correlation in PolyMedica's stock price returns weighed strongly against a finding of market efficiency. According to the Companys FORM 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, on February 23, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion in the District Court to re-certify the class for the period from January 2001 through August 2001, which the defendants opposed. On March 23, 2006, the Court held an evidentiary hearing relating to class certification and on March 31, 2006 the Court heard oral argument regarding class certification. The Court took the motion under advisement. Discovery is ongoing in the underlying suit. The case is currently scheduled for trial in April 2007. As summarized by the same SEC filing, on July 30, 2001, the Court granted the plaintiffs motion to consolidate the complaints under the caption In re: PolyMedica Corp. Securities Litigation, Civ. Action No. 00-12426-REK. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on October 9, 2001. The consolidated amended complaint extended the class period to October 26, 1998 through August 21, 2001, and named as defendants PolyMedica, Liberty, and certain former officers of PolyMedica. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on December 10, 2001. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to this motion on February 11, 2002, and defendants filed a reply memorandum on March 11, 2002. The Court denied the motion without a hearing on May 10, 2002. On June 20, 2002, defendants filed answers to the consolidated amended complaint. On January 28, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification to which defendants filed an opposition on February 27, 2004. Plaintiffs filed a reply memorandum on April 12, 2004 followed by additional briefing by the parties. The Court heard oral argument on the motion on June 2, 2004. On September 8, 2004, the court allowed the plaintiffs motion and certified the class. On September 21, 2004, the defendants filed a petition requesting that they be permitted to appeal the decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs filed a response to the defendants petition on October 7, 2004 opposing defendants request to appeal the class certification. Also on October 7, 2004, the Court stayed sending notice of the class action pending a ruling on defendants appeal of class certification. On February 15, 2005, the First Circuit Court of Appeals granted defendants petition for leave to appeal the class certification decision. Defendants-appellants filed their brief on March 15, 2005, and plaintiffs-appellees filed an opposition on April 15, 2005. Defendants-appellants filed a reply brief on April 25, 2005. The First Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral argument on May 4, 2005 and took the matter under advisement. On December 13, 2005, the First Circuit Court of Appeals rendered a decision in defendants-appellants favor and entered an order vacating the District Court??s order certifying the class for the period from January 2001 through August 2001 and remanded the matter for further proceeding",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

The settlement is subject to documentation and Court approval. The settlement agreement makes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company or its officers and directors. The amounts necessary to fund this settlement will be paid by insurance carriers for the Company.  As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q For The Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2006, the Company and certain of its directors and key executive officers are defendants in several purported class actions that were filed in 2003 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by alleged purchasers of the Companys Class A Common stock, 4.25% Senior Convertible Debt due 2022 and 8.50% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2018. On June 28, 2004, the District Court issued an order consolidating the cases under the caption In Re PMA Capital Corporation Securities Litigation  (civil action no. 03-6121) and appointing Sheet Metal Workers Local 9 Pension Trust, Alaska Laborers Employers Retirement Fund and Communications Workers of America for Employees Pension and Death Benefits as lead plaintiff. On September 20, 2004, the plaintiffs filed an amended and consolidated complaint on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of the Companys securities between May 5, 1999 and February 11, 2004. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by making materially false and misleading public statements and material omissions during the class period regarding the Companys underwriting performance, loss reserves and related internal controls. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 11, 12(a) (2) and 15 of the Securities Act by making materially false and misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses about the Companys financial results, underwriting performance, loss reserves and related internal controls. By Order dated July 27, 2005, the District Court partially granted the Companys previously filed Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, dismissing all allegations with respect to The PMA Insurance Group, and otherwise denied the Motion to Dismiss. By virtue of the Order, the alleged class period was reduced to November 6, 2003 Various lawsuits have been filed against PMA Capital Corporation (PMA) alleging that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market, causing the company's stock to reach an artificially high price. The first complaint filed allege that PMA's public statements during the Class Period were materially false and misleading because (a) PMA  maintained inadequate loss reserves for its PMA Re subsidiary (b) reserve increases for PMA Re announced during the Class Period were materially insufficient and (c) as a consequence of the understatement of loss reserves, PMA's earnings and assets were materially overstated at all relevant times. This action was filed on behalf of all who purchased PMA's securities between May 7, 2003 and November 3, 2003. Similar complaint filed on behalf of purchasers of the securities of PMA between November 13, 1998 and November 3, 2003, alleges that during the Class Period, the Company represented that it had established adequate loss reserves to pay or settle losses arising from insurance claims made by PMA policy holders, and that any estimated claims were revised according to the availability of new information. According to the complaint, defendants created favorable conditions for PMA to complete two offerings of convertible senior debentures and monthly inc""me senior notes during the Class Period, valued at $75 million and $50 million, respectively. In addition, the complaint alleges, defendants sought to obtain positive ratings from insurance industry rating agencies which would enable them to underwrite insurance policies and negotiate reinsurance treaties, worth millions of dollars in premiums, to purchasers who relied on such ratings as a measurement of PMA's capital structure.  Another complaint was filed on behalf of all persons who specifically purchased or otherwise acquired securities of PMA Capital Corporation issued in public offerings dated October 16, 2002 and June 5, 2003 pursuant to a Registration Statement dated July 18, 2002 and Prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Prospectus Supplements dated October 16, 2002 in connection with the offering of 4.25% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the ""4.25% Debentures"") and dated June 5, 2003 in connection with the offering of 8.5% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2018 (the ""8.5% Notes"") (AMEX:PMK) (collectiv",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

On May 27, 2005, the Company received final approval of the settlement by the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. Under the terms of the $12 million settlement, the Company will pay $250,000 and its insurers will pay the remaining $11,750,000. This settlement fully resolves these claims against the Company and several of its current and former officers and directors. As summarized in the Notice of Pendency of Class Action, dated March 17, 2005, on October 9, 2002, the Court ordered the seven actions consolidated for all purposes under the caption In re PEMSTAR, Inc.

Brody, Keith Hewlett, Jr. and Keith Hewlett, Sr., as Lead Plaintiffs, approved Lead Plaintiffs selection of Lead Counsel and Liaison Counsel, and provided for the filing of a consolidated amended complaint. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on or about January 7, 2003. On January 13, 2003, pla""ntiffs filed the [Corrected] Consolidated Complaint. On July 25, 2003, Defendants moved to dismiss the [Corrected] Consolidated Complaint with prejudice. Lead Plaintiffs opposed Defendants?? motion, and it was denied by this Court on August 15, 2003. On December 23, 2004, Plaintiffs filed the [Corrected] Interlineated Amended Consolidated Complaint (the ??Complaint??), and Defendants moved to dismiss certain claims and Defendants from the Complaint on January 8, 2005. While this motion was pending, the Parties reached an agreement in principle on January 20, 2005, to settle the Litigation.  The original complaint charges PEMSTAR and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants caused PEMSTAR's shares to trade at artificially inflated levels through the issuance of false and misleading statements. The Registration Statement and Prospectus for the June 8, 2001 Secondary Offering (""ondary Offering"") were materially false and misleading when issued as they misrepresented and/or omitted one or more of the following adverse facts which then existed and disclosure of which was necessary to make the statements made not false and/or misleading, including, but not limited to: (a) In order to attract and maintain the appearance of a diverse customer base, PEMSTAR: (i) executed orders from customers without industry track records or acceptable financial conditions, in fact, several were on the brink of bankruptcy and (ii) had an extremely liberal policy of accepting and holding inventory for and from existing and prospective customers (often without ever obtaining a written contract), the result of which was that PEMSTAR significantly increased its costs of doing business and was forced to write down obsolete inventory. In fact, a substantial amount of the Company's inventory was already obsolete. (b) Due to a lack of internal controls, reflected, but not acknowledged in PEMSTAR's contracts with Datasweep: (i) PEMSTAR's ""cash conversion cycle,"" or the amount of time between the purchase of inventory and the collection of payment, was dramatically lower than its competitors', which resulted in PEMSTAR having to write down material amounts of accounts receivables and (ii) PEMSTAR's ""days sales outstanding,"" the number of days PEMSTAR had to wait payment for sales, was dramatically lower than its competitors', which resulted in PEMSTAR having to write down material amounts of accounts receivables.  The complaint further claims that the true facts which were known to the  defendants but concealed from the public following the Secondary Offering were as follows: (a) The Company was in violation of its financial loan covenants  (b) The Company's inventory and accounts receivables valuations were grossly overstated (c) Defendants needed to keep the Company's shares artificially inflated to complete the Company's convertible offering (d) The Company was then experiencing lower than projected utilization rates at the Company's higher cost locations which",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

Panera Bread engages in the ownership and franchising of bakery-cafes in the United States under the Panera Bread and Saint Louis Bread Company names. According to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, the Company highlighted its increasing system-wide sales and, as a result, continuously increased its earnings guidance. Moreover, the Company was rapidly opening new locations throughout the United States. Unbeknownst to shareholders, the Companys aggressive growth strategy was causing the Company to experience declining sales at its existing stores. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose (i) that the Company was experiencing negative trends in its business which were causing it to experience rising expenses and slow growth (ii) that the Companys store expansion strategy was causing the Company to yield a lower return on capital and experience a decline in sales per restaurant as the Companys new store openings began to cannibalize sales from existing stores and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company, its prospects and revenue growth rate.

According to the Notice of Pendency and Settlement of Class Action dated July 1, 2005, asettlement hearing will be held on September 23, 2005 at 9 a.m., before the Honorable Susan C. Bucklew, United States District Judge, at the Sam M. Gibbons United States Courthouse & Federal Building, 801 North Florida Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33602  (the Settlement Hearing).  The Settlement Hearings purpose will be to determine:  (1) whether the Settlement, consisting of an $8,150,000 cash fund, plus accrued interest for the benefit of the Class, should be approved as fair, just, reasonable and adequate (2) whether the proposed plan to distribute the Settlement proceeds described herein (the Plan of Allocation) is fair, just, reasonable, and adequate  (3) whether Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel have adequately represented the Class (4) whether Plaintiffs Counsels application for an attorneys fees and expenses award should be approved and (5) whether the Action should be dismissed with prejudice.

Finkbiner and Samuel M. Hensley (the Named Defendants).  On May 11, 2004, the Court consolidated the pending actions.  On June 28, 2004, the Court appointed Jemmco Investment Management, LLC Lead Plaintiff and approved Jemmco??s choice of counsel, Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, LLP as Lead Counsel and liaison counsel for the Class in this Action.  The Court initially required Lead Plaintiff to submit a consolidated, amended complaint by August 27, 2004, but in view of a scheduled mediation, the Court extended that deadline.  Before the mediation, Lead Plaintiff prepared a draft Consolidated Amended Complaint (the ??Complaint??), which names the Defendants as parties in the Action.  Under an agreed order, Lead Plaintiff was to file the Complaint on January 31, 2005.  Because the Parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding on January 18, 2005, they agreed to postpone the Complaint??s filing indefinitely. The original complaint charges Quality Distribution and cert""ndividuals with violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of  1933. On or about November 7, 2003, Quality Distribution commenced an initial  public offering of 7 million of its shares of common stock at an offering price  of $17.00 per share (the ""IPO""), thereby raising approximately $110.7 million.  In connection therewith, Quality Distribution filed a registration statement,  which incorporated a prospectus (the ""Prospectus""), with the SEC. The complaint  alleges that the Prospectus was materially false and misleading because Quality  Distribution materially overstated its financial results and its financial  statements were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles (""GAAP"").  Further, the complaint alleges that on February 2, 2004, the Company announced that it expected to take a fourth-  quarter charge and restate its results back to 2001 after discovering insurance  law violations at Power Purchasing Inc.

According to the complaint, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements that misrepresented and failed to disclose (i) RAIT's financial relationship with American Home Mortgage (""AHM"") that (ii) the payment to RAIT by American Home Mortgage of the TruPS was in jeopardy, which could result in at least a net exposure of $95 million, or $1.56 per share of book value and that (iii) RAIT had failed to adequately reserve for the risk of nonpayment of American Home Mortgage and the loss in value of the associated securities in an amount of approximately $95 million. On July 31, 2007, RAIT surprised the market by announcing that it did not receive payment from AHM of trust preferred securities due on July 30, 2007 from AHM, resulting in at least a net equity exposure of $95 million.

In a press release dated November 30, 2007, the above-captioned action has been certified as a class action and that a settlement for $3.6 million has been proposed. A hearing will be held before the Honorable David Folsom in the United States Courthouse, 3rd Floor, 500 N. State Line Ave., Texarkana, Texas 75504, at 10:00 a.m., on Wednesday, February 6, 2008 to determine whether the proposed settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and to consider the application of Plaintiffs' Counsel for attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses. As summarized by the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2007, similar complaints were consolidated by the court with the Walker matter in October 2002. On November 25, 2002, the lead plaintiffs in the Walker matter filed an amended consolidated complaint which added certain of our outside directors as defendants to the Exchange Act claims. The amended complaint also added additional claims that we, and certain of our current and former officers and directors, violated various provisions of the Securities Act as a result of alleged misrepresentations and omissions in connection with an offering in May 2001 and also added the managing underwriters in that offering as defendants. On July 25, 2005, the court dismissed with prejudice the claims against our outside directors as well as the underwriter defendants, but denied our motion to dismiss. A hearing on class certification was held on June 22, 2006. On October 29, 2007, before the court ruled on class certification, we announced that we had reached a prospective settlement with the plaintiffs to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, which has now been documented and was preliminarily approved by the court on October 31, 2007, we anticipate our insurance carrier will pay an aggregate of $3.6 million in cash, which will be distributed to an agreed upon class of claimants who purchased our common stock from April 25, 2001 through October 8, 2001, as well as used to pay costs of notice and settlement administration, and plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses.

The terms of the settlement are subject to obtaining final approval from the court. The original complaint charges Rent-A-Center and certain of its officers and directors with issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market during the Class Period, thereby artificially inflating the price of Rent-A-Center publicly traded securities. For example, on April 25, 2001, Rent-A-Center issued a press release announcing record results for the first quarter of 2001 and highlighting the Company's resilience in a weakening economy. The representations in the press release were, according to the allegations of the complaint, materially false and misleading because the Company did not disclose that its expenses were rising dramatically as Rent-A-Center attempted to combat weakening demand with deep discounts and promotions. While in possession of this adverse non-public information, Rent-A-Center completed a secondary offering of 3,200,000 shares of its common stock at $42.50 per share on May 25, 2001.

The settlement requires no payment by the Company or any of the individual defendants named in the lawsuit. The Companys primary insurance carrier agreed to make the required payment under the settlement, the amount of which is immaterial to the Company. The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing by Regeneron or any of the individual defendants. Separately, the plaintiffs and the individual defendants named in the lawsuit entered into a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, which dismissed all claims against the individuals with prejudice.

At the Settlement Fairness Hearing, the Court also will consider the proposed Plan of Allocation for the proceeds of the settlement and the motion of Plaintiffs Co-Lead Counsel for attorneys fees and reimbursement of expenses.

Pauley, III, awarding attorney fees and expenses.  That day, the Court entered the Order and Final Judgment.  The case is now closed. According to a press release dated January 22, 2008, a New York federal judge has approved a $13.5 million settlement of a securities class action between Renaissance Re Holdings and stockholders who sued the reinsurer for allegedly engaging in sham reinsurance transactions that artificially increased the company's earnings. Last September, U.S. District Judge William Pauley III granted a preliminary approval of the settlement but decided to render a final judgment on whether the deal was ""fair, adequate and reasonable"" in January (BestWire, Oct. 5, 2007). In his ruling, Pauley stated that there was no doubt the settlement was the result of arm's length negotiations. However, the judge balked at the request by class counsel, which consists of attorneys for the lead plaintiffs, to be paid $3.37 million or what amounts to 25% of the settlement. By the judge's calculation, the $3.37 million fee yields a blended hourly rate of approximately $1,640. Also, a 25% attorney's fee will leave less than $10 million, after reimbursement of expenses, to be divvied up by 52,000 plaintiffs, said the judge, who called the request unreasonable. Pauley ruled that the class counsel should instead take home $1.33 million, a recovery of about 10%. In a press release dated October 5, 2007, the action has been certified as a class action for settlement purposes and that a Settlement for Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000) has been reached. A hearing will be held before the Honorable William H. Pauley in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 10007, at 12:00 p.m., on January 11, 2008, to determine whether: (1) the proposed Settlement and plan of allocation of Settlement proceeds should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable and adequate (2) Co-Lead Counsel's application for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses should be approved (3) Lead Plaintiffs should be reimbursed for their reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages) directly related to their representation of the Class in the litigation and (4) the claims against Defendants should be dismissed with prejudice.

In December 2005, these actions were consolidated and in February 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased and/or acquired the publicly traded securities of the Company between April 22, 2003 and July 25, 2005. In June 2006, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On October 24, 2006, before those motions were ruled upon, counsel for the lead plaintiffs requested permission from the Court to move for leave to file a second amended complaint. On October 30, 2006, the defendants consented to that request. Once the new complaint is filed, it is expected that the defendants will file motions to dismiss the new complaint.  Several purported shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed against RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. and certain of its present and former executive officers alleging that Defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1034 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants issued a series of false and misleading statements to the market regarding the Company's financial condition. The complaint further alleges that these statements were false and misleading because:  -- In 2001, RenaissanceRe entered into various contracts with Inter-Ocean, which were used by Defendants to smooth and manipulate the earnings of the Company in the years 2002 through 2004 -- RenaissanceRe failed to properly account for the timing of the recognition of reinsurance recoverables, which had the impact of misstating net income by as much as 12 percent in a given year -- RenaissanceRe failed to properly account for the timing of the recognition of premium on multi-year ceded reinsurance contracts in the first three quarters of 2004 -- As a result, the Company's financial reports were not prepared in acco""dance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"").  The complaint further alleges that beginning in mid 2004, numerous companies involved in the reinsurance industry began receiving subpoenas regarding their business practices, and inquiring about their use and sale of reinsurance contracts. On February 22, 2005, RenaissanceRe announced that it planned to restate its financial statements for 2001, 2002, and 2003 to correct ""accounting errors associated with reinsurance ceded by the Company."" In addition, RenaissanceRe announced that it ""had discovered an error in the timing of the recognition of premium on multi-year ceded reinsurance contracts for the first three quarters of 2004."" On July 11, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing that it had received and accepted the resignation of Michael W. Cash, Senior Vice President of Specialty Reinsurance for the Company, after he voluntarily refused to accept the subpoenas of the SEC calling for his testimony in its investigation of the Company's restatement. On July 25, 2005, the Company announced that Defendant Standard had received a ""Wells Notice"" from the SEC in regard to the agency's investigation of the Company's financial statements.

While the Company and the individual defendants continue to believe that the actions were properly dismissed by the district court, a decision was made to enter into these memoranda of understanding to avoid the burden, risk and expense that would result from the continued pursuit by plaintiffs of the appeals and underlying claims in these lawsuits. The proposed Andropolis settlement involves a $1.5 million payment, covered by insurance, to the putative class and its counsel. The proposed Wilster settlement involves the payment of $250,000 to plaintiff's counsel, also covered by insurance, and an agreement to adopt certain corporate governance measures.

On December 14, 2009 and December 15, 2009, Rentech announced that the Company had improperly reported certain deposit payments as inventory on its balance sheets in various filings with the SEC in 2008 and 2009. In response to the Company??s announcement, Rentech shares plunged to $1.27 a share on December 18, 2009, representing a 25% drop from the stock??s opening price on December 14, 2009.

On December 04, 2007, there was unopposed Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement and Plan of Allocation, Request for Incentive Award, Attorneys' Fees and Reimbursement of Expenses.  On December 11, 2007, a Final Order And Judgment on the Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement and Plan of Allocation, Request for Incentive Award, Motion for Attorneys' Fees was entered. According to a press release dated August 15, 2007, hearing will be held in this case on December 11, 2007 at 10:00 A.M. before United States District Judge Jane Boyle, at the United States Courthouse, 1100 Commerce Street, Dallas, Texas 75242, to determine: (1) whether the settlement of claims asserted in this Action in return for payment of One Million, Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000.00) in cash plus accrued interest (the ""Settlement Fund""), from which all administrative expenses, taxes owed and Court-awarded attorneys' fees and expenses will be paid, should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable and adequate to the members of the Settlement Class (2) whether the proposed plan of allocation for the Settlement Fund after payment of all administrative expenses, taxes owed and Court-awarded attorneys' fees and expenses (the ""Plan of Allocation"") is fair, reasonable and adequate to the members of the Settlement Class (3) whether and in what amount to approve an incentive award to the Lead Plaintiff and whether to approve the application of the Class' Lead Counsel for an award of attorneys' fees not in excess of 33% and expenses not in excess of $150,000.00 should be approved and (4) whether the Action should be dismissed with prejudice as set forth in the Settlement Agreement dated as of March 15, 2007 and filed with the Court. On October 30, 2006, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  The parties went into mediation, and on March 20, 2007, the Court entered and Order signed by U.S. District Judge Jane J. Boyle.  As stated by the Order, the parties have informed the Court that this case has settled. Accordingly, the Court orders the parties to present to the Court a final judgment or agreed order of dismissal on or before April 9, 2007. On August 16, 2006, the Court entered the Memorandum Order signed by U.S. District Judge Jane J. Boyle denying the defendants?? motion to (1) To Amend June 2, 2006 Order to Certify Question for Interlocutory Appeal and (2) To Stay Litigation.  On October 18, 2006, the Court issued its First Scheduling Order.  According to the Order, pursuant to Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court finds that this case should preliminarily proceed according to the following schedule: Plaintiffs shall file a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""CAC"") by October 30, 2006. Defendants shall have until November 22, 2006 in which to answer or otherwise move to dismiss Plaintiffs' SCAC.  According to the Company??s FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, in September 2005, the Court dismissed the action because the lead plaintiff previously selected by the Court had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. As a result, the Court also dismissed the class action complaint. Subsequently, a different member of the purported class asked to be substituted as a new lead plaintiff. In June 2006, the Court granted that request and reinstated the action. The defendants believe that the Court erred in doing so and has asked the Court to certify the issue for an immediate appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The new lead plaintiff ""s opposed that request. The Court has yet to rule. The complaint charges Ryland Group and certain of its officers with violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Between October 22, 2003 and January 7, 2004, the defendants issued a series of material misrepresentations to the market concerning the Company's financial results. More specifically, the defendants' statements during the Class Period were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts, among others: (1) that the Texas market (and particularly Dallas) was in a freefall (2) that Texas buyers were proving highly resistant to the entry level homes that Ryland Group was ",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

According to the Order, the plaintiffs counsel is awarded $3,741,083.09 in reimbursement of expenses and 14% of the settlement fund for their attorney fees. According to a press release dated May 18, 2006, Sears, Roebuck and Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Holdings Corporation, announced the company has reached a preliminary agreement to settle class action litigation brought on behalf of purchasers of Sears, Roebuck securities during the period from October 24, 2001 through and including October 14, 2002 that had been pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and captioned In re Sears, Roebuck and Co. Securities Litigation, No. 02 C 07527. The litigation concerned statements made by Sears Roebuck concerning its credit card business during the class period. Sears, Roebuck sold that business in November 2003. Under the settlement, Sears, Roebuck is required to make a payment of $215 million. The company has made claims under relevant insurance policies, and expects that, after giving effect to anticipated insurance proceeds, the cash payment for settlement by Sears, Roebuck will be approximately $85 million on a pre-tax basis. Because Sears Holdings had established a reserve for the expected settlement by Sears, Roebuck, the settlement is not expected to have an effect on earnings. The settlement is subject to judicial approval. By the Notice of Pendency of Class Action dated March 18, 2005, on April 14, 2003 and May 5, 2003, the Court issued Orders appointing The Department of the Treasury of the State of New Jersey and its Division of Investment as the Lead Plaintiff in the Action and approved its choice of Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman LLP as Lead Counsel and Miller Faucher and Cafferty LLP as Liaison Counsel in the Action. On June 16, 2003, the New Jersey Treasury Department filed its Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint For Violations Of Federal Securities Law alleging that the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in public documents and statements they disseminated during the Class Period to the investing public, including press releases and financial reports, thereby allegedly artificially inflating the price of Sears?? common stock. On July 16, 2003, the Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. By Order dated October 23, 2003, the Court denied the Defendants?? motions to dismiss. This ruling assumed the truth of the allegations of the Complaint and did not make factual findings. On November 14, 2003, the Defendants answered the Complaint. The D""ndants deny all allegations of wrongdoing asserted against them.  The original complaint charges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market between January 17, 2002 to October 17, 2002. According to the complaint, defendants, throughout the Class Period, represented that Sears was growing its  earnings strongly, driven by its Credit and Financial Products segment and that it would achieve earnings growth of 22% in 2002 over 2001. In addition, in each of its press releases and SEC reports filed during the Class Period, Sears reported its provisions for uncollectible accounts and in, its 2001 annual report represented that such reserves were ""adequate.""

On January 25, 2005, Judge Robert W. Gettleman granted the motion to appoint the Sellers Group as lead plaintiffs and approved lead plaintiff??s selection of the law firms of Squitieri & Fearon, LLP and the Law Offices of Charles J.  Piven as co-lead counsel.  On March 11, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, and on May 2, 2005, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint.  On March 22, 2006, Judge Gettleman denied all defendants?? motion to dismiss.  On April 7, 2006, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying the motion to dismiss.  In a press release dated August 15, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied a defendant company's motion to reconsider the district court's dismissal of a securities""aud class action against it. The district court also denied a motion to certify an appeal.

Sears and ESL moved to dismiss, and the court previously denied the motion to dismiss. Sears moved the court to reconsider the motion for dismissal. ESL moved for certification of appeal of the question of ""ether ??18(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 provides the exclusive remedy for a plaintiff alleging a stock owner's untimely amendment of a statement filed pursuant to ??13(d) or ??13(g)."" state a claim under ??10(b), shareholders must allege that the defendant knowingly made a material misstatement or omission in connection with the sale or purchase of securities with scienter, upon which the plaintiffs relied, and caused the plaintiffs' economic loss. ??

The district court denied ESL's motion for certification of an appeal because there was not substantial ground for difference of opinion, as the plaintiffs' claims did not fall within the plain wording of ??18(a).

Under the terms of the settlement, the Companys insurers will pay $4.0 million into a settlement fund, and the Company will pay up to $50,000 of the costs of providing notice of the settlement to settlement class members. The Company recorded a liability in its December 31, 2004 consolidated financial statements for the proposed amount of the settlement of $4,050,000. Because the insurance carrier involved in this suit agreed to pay $4.0 million of the settlement amount, and therefore recovery from the insurance carrier was probable, a receivable was also recorded for that amount. These amounts were paid into the settlement fund in April 2005. The District Court approved the settlement on August 8, 2005, and the Company does not expect any further legal action related to this matter. As disclosed by the same SEC filing, the Company and certain of its officers were named as a defendant in several substantially identical class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in April 2004. The cases were consolidated in August 2004, and the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in October 2004. The plaintiffs allege securities law violations by the Company and certain of its officers and directors under Rule 10b-5 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class of people who purchased our stock during the period between January 9, 2004 and March 1, 2004 and seeks unspecified damages. The plaintiffs base their allegations primarily on the fact that the Company did not achieve its forecasted revenue guidance of $10 to $13 million for the first quarter of 2004. The original complaint charges defendants with violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between the class period, thereby artificially inflating the price of Superconductor's common stock. The complaint charges the Company and certain of its officers and directors for violations of the federal securities laws. During the Class Period, it is alleged that the Company projected first quarter 2004 revenues to be in the range of 10 to 13 million dollars. However, in actuality, first quarter revenues were later announced to be closer to 4 million dollars, due to changes in demand made by two of the Company??s customers.

Three similar complaints were filed soon thereafter. All complaints had asserted a putative class period commencing on June 17, 2005 and ending on October 6, 2005. On March 17, 2006, these purported class actions were consolidated, with El Paso Fireman & Policemans Pension Fund designated as Lead Plaintiff. Lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint on or about June 14, 2006. The consolidated complaint alleges claims similar to those described above and expands the putative class period to commence on May 2, 2001 and to end on March 10, 2006. On September 13, 2006, Stone and the individual defendants filed motions seeking dismissal of that action. The original Complaint alleges defendants, Stone Energy and certain of its officers and directors, violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false statements. The Company engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, operation, and production of oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, various basins of the Rocky Mountains, and Williston basin oil of North Dakota and Montana. Specifically, the complaint alleges defendants failed to disclose and misrepresented the following adverse facts: (i) that Stone Energy was materially overstating its financial results by overvaluing its oil reserves through improper and aggressive reserve methodologies. Stone Energy has now launched an internal investigation into its reserve practices and admitted that it overstated its oil reserves and that it will be restating its financial statements for 2001 to 2004 and for the first six months of 2005 (ii) that the Company lacked adequate in""ernal controls and was therefore unable to ascertain its true financial condition and (iii) that as a result of the foregoing, the values of the Company's proven reserves, assets and future net cash flows were materially overstated at all relevant times.  The complaint further alleges that on or around October 6, 2005, Stone Energy issued a press release announcing that it intends to take a significant reserve write-down, among other things. On this news, the price of Stone Energy stock fell $7.93 per share or almost 14% to close at $48.14 per share. Then, on November 8, 2005, Stone Energy issued a press release announcing that it will restate its financial statements for the periods from 2001 to 2004 and for the first six months of 2005. On December 11, 2006 the defendants filed a notice that their September 2006 motion to dismiss was to be changed to a motion for summary judgment.  The motions were referred to Magistrate Judge Methvin for briefing, who submitted her August 17, 2007 ""Reports and Recommendations"" calling for the section 10b claims be dismissed against two individuals, that the claims of plaintiffs who sold their shares before the October 6, 2005 disclosure by Stone of the reserve errors be dismissed, but that the motions to dismiss be denied as to all other claims asserted by plaintiffs.

The complaint alleges that in particular, defendants: (1) through the October 31, 2006 transaction, along with several other transactions for which the company improperly accounted, inflated Shuffle Master's quarterly earnings per share by 50% and year-end earnings per share by 35% and (2) the fraudulent booking of inter-company transactions arose out of Shuffle Master's tax avoidance scheme, whereby the Company transferred profits that were otherwise taxable in the U.S., to foreign countries where profits would be taxed at a much lower rate, if at all. On March 12, 2007, Shuffle Master admitted that it had improperly booked the October 31, 2006 transaction, and that it would have to restate reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2006. The company further admitted that its internal controls were defective. In response, Shuffle Master's stock fell 8%. On August 2, 2007, Judge Kent J.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that following ShoreTel's July 3, 2007 IPO -- which raised gross proceeds of at least $86.3075 million -- investors learned the truth about the Company on January 7, 2008 -- including that the problems which existed at the time of the IPO would result in extremely disappointing results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 (the period ended December 31, 2007), including much lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs and expenses. At that time, defendants first belatedly revealed that sales to new customers were substantially lower than expected, and that sales to existing customers was not sufficient to offset these declines. In addition, by this time, it became obvious to investors that the Company did not maintain adequate internal controls, and that a proper due diligence investigation into the Company, by the Underwriters, was not properly carried out prior to the Offering. On this news, on January 7, 2008, over 6.0 million shares of ShoreTel traded -- over 20 times average daily trading volume -- and Company shares plummeted -- falling over 50% to close at $6.02 per share.

As summarized by the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended November 25, 2005, additional complaints making similar allegations were subsequently filed in the same court, and pursuant to an order entered June 2, 2003, the Court appointed lead counsel and plaintiffs to represent the putative class in a single consolidated action. The Consolidated Amended Complaint, filed September 8, 2003, alleges an expanded class period of June 18, 2001 through September 26, 2002, and purports to add a claim for violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), on behalf of a putative class of former shareholders of C-MAC Industries, Inc., who acquired Solectron stock pursuant to the October 19, 2001 Registration Statement filed in connection with Solectrons acquisition of C-MAC Industries, Inc. In addition, while the initial complaints focused on alleged inventory issues at the former Technology Solutions business unit, the Consolidated Amended Complaint adds allegations of inadequate disclosure and failure to properly account for excess and obsolete inventory at Solectron??s other business units. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of the putative class. On February 13, 2004 the Court denied defendants?? motion to dismiss the Complaint and on September 2, 2004 the Court signed an order provisionally certifying the Class.

Defendants carried out this scheme by intentionally manipulating the grant dates of stock options awarded to themselves and other officers and directors of the Company and selecting grant dates at which Semtech stock traded at much lower prices than the actual grant dates. In public disclosures, however, Defendants falsely claimed that the grants were dated and priced as of the date of the actual grants. The complaint further alleges that on July 20, 2006, Semtech revealed that it expected to record material amounts of additional compensation expense and that it expected to restate its financial results from fiscal 2002 through 2006, while it also disclosed that its prior financial statements should not be relied upon. Semtech's share price fell in reaction to this announcement, falling from $13.19 to $12.37 per share. Semtech shares continued to fall in reaction to the news on July 21, 2006, closing at $11.60 per share.

According to the Order, the Court appoints Class member the Mississippi Public Employees' Retirement System to serve as Lead Plaintiff in the consolidated action. In addition, Cauley Bowman Carney & Williams, PLLC, and Baron & Budd, P.C. are approved as Co-Lead Counsel. According to a press release dated October 13, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted a motion that sought the consolidation of two purported securities fraud class-action lawsuits against Semtech Corp.  The plaintiffs demand a jury trial but make no specific monetary demand.  A very similar lawsuit was filed in October 2007 by another plaintiff, which suit has not been served to the company.  In February 2008, MPERS filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California for consolidation of the cases, appointment of MPERS as lead plaintiff, and approval of selection of counsel.  The MPERS motion was granted in late March 2008, according to the company's Sept. 4, 2008 Form 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter ended July 27, 2008. As summarized by the Company's FORM 10-K For the fiscal year ended January 25, 2009, a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint was filed in May 2008, initiating the consolidated action with MPERS as the lead plaintiff. Most recently, motions to dismiss and for other remedial actions filed by the defendants were heard by the Court on December 15, 2008. The Court granted motions to dismiss in favor of defendants former Chief Executive Officer of the Company and current Chief Executive Officer of the Company regarding claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Court denied all other motions of all defendants, including other motions to dismiss brought in relation to alternate allegations raised against the former and current CEO who remain pending as defendants in the matter.

Sonic develops and markets computer software related to digital media, such as data, photographs, audio and video in digital formats. The complaint alleges that prior to the Class Period, Sonic had manipulated its stock option accounting which caused its SEC filings made during the Class Period to be false. Also during the Class Period, Sonic and its top officers made false and misleading statements about its business and prospects, all while concealing its false stock option grant practices, causing its stock to trade at artificially inflated levels. On February 1, 2007, Sonic announced that it had commenced a voluntary review of its historical and current stock option grant practices and related accounting. Then, on May 17, 2007, after the market closed, Sonic announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2007, and stated that based on its previous review, Sonic lacked sufficient documentation for certain historical option grants and that the measurement dates associated with these option grants will need to be adjusted. The Company further stated that it will have to record additional cash and non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense and restate previous financial statements, and that such charges will be material. On this news, Sonic's stock collapsed from $13.37 per share to as low as $11.76 per share on volume of 1.8 million shares. This drop continued a decline from $18 per share which began in February 2007, when Sonic first disclosed its stock option problems. On January 10, 2008, the Court issued the Order by Martin J.

The complaint alleges that defendants issued numerous statements which highlighted the Companys financial performance and described the Companys success in acquiring and/or developing new products which it was then able to offer to current and prospective customers. As alleged in the complaint, these statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts, among others: (1) that certain products that Sonus claimed it had sold to Qwest Communications International, Inc. (Qwest) would not be ready for deployment in time to meet Qwests needs and would result in Qwest having to purchase competing products from Nortel (2) that the Companys highly-touted transaction with Qwest, which contributed more than 10% of Sonus first quarter 2001 revenues, was actually a quid pro quo deal wherein Sonus had to agree to buy a $20 million Irrevocable Right of Use (IRUs) from Qwest in exchange for a $20 million order from Qwest (3) that contrary to defendants representations, Sonus products were not carrier class as they did not have 99.999% availability, did not have voice quality as good as circuit-switched networks and did not have sophisticated network management and configuration capabilities and (4) as a result, Sonus was not on track to report revenues of $195 million in 2001. On January 16, 2002, the last day of the Class Period, Sonus announced its disappointing fourth quarter ""nd year-end 2001 results and revealed that revenues for the year were just $173 million compared to Class Period estimates exceeding $200 million. Following this announcement, shares of Sonus stock fell below $5 per share. As summarized by the Company??s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, beginning in July 2002, several purchasers of our common stock filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against us, certain officers and directors and a former officer under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act (the ""lass Action Complaints""). The purchasers sought to represent a class of persons who purchased our common stock between December 11, 2000 and January 16, 2002, and sought unspecified monetary damages. The Class Action Complaints were essentially identical and alleged that we made false and misleading statements about our products and business. On March 3, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint. On April 22, 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint on various grounds. On May 11, 2004, the Court held oral argument on the motion, at the conclusion of which the Court denied our motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 30, 2004. On February 16, 2005, the Court certified the class and appointed a class representative. On March 9, 2005, the Court appointed the law firm of Moulton & Gans as lead counsel. After the Court requested additional briefing on the adequacy of the class representative, the class representative withdrew. Lead counsel then filed a motion to substitute a new plaintiff as the class representative. On May 19, 2005, the court held a hearing on the motion and took the matter under advisement. On August 15, 2005, the Court issued an order decertifying the class and requiring the parties to submit a joint report informing the Court whether the cases have been settled and whether defendants would be seeking to recover attorney's fees from the plaintiffs. On September 30, 2005, the plaintiffs filed motions to voluntarily dismiss their complaints with prejudice. On October 5, 2005, the Court entered an order dismissing the cases. On June 26, 2006, the Court issued an order denying our motion for recovery of attorneys' fees. We do not have any directors and officers insurance available for this claim. On January 6, 2006, a purchaser of our common stock filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that is essentially identical to the Class Action Complaints that were dismissed on October 5, 2005. The Court appointed the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi as lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff filed an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on March 5, 2007 (""Amended Complaint""). On April 19, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. In September 2008 we agreed to settle the litigation and, on October 3, 2008, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiff setting forth the terms of the settlement.

Pursuant to the settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company has agreed to pay $40 million to the shareholder classes in the case. The Company has recorded a $40 million charge and related liability in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 for the full amount of the settlement. According to an article dated October 31, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted a stock broker's motion for class certification of a securities fraud class action against Sonus Networks, finding that the broker had standing to sue the company because it purchased the stock directly and relied upon the company's alleged misrepresentations to buy the stock.  On June 29, 2007, Sonus filed a motion for reconsideration of the judge's ruling denying their motion to dismiss.  Defendants claim that in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Tellabs v Makor case, the ""fraudulent intent may be plausible, yet less cogent, than other, nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct.""   On May 10, 2006, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock issued the Memoradum and Order granting in part and denying in part the defendants motions to dismiss the First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint.

As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006, beginning in February 2004, a number of purported shareholder class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Sonus and certain of its current officers and directors. On June 28, 2004, the court consolidated the claims. On December 1, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint. The complaint asserts claims under the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11, 12(a), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, relating to Sonus restatement of its financial results for 2001, 2002, and the first three quarters of 2003. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Sonus issued a series of false or misleading statements to the market concerning our revenues, earnings, and financial position. Plaintiffs contend that such statements caused Sonus?? stock price to be artificially inflated. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Sonus?? common stock during the period from March 28, 2002 through March 26, 2004. On January 28, 2005, Sonus filed a motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) and 12(a) claims and joined the motion to dismiss the Section 11 claim filed by the individual defendants. On June 1, 2005, the court held a hearing on the motion and allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint that included the same claims and substantially similar allegations as set forth in the prior complaint.

Among other things, plaintiff claims that defendants' material omissions and dissemination of materially false and misleading statements concerning the Company's business and operations caused Spectranetics' stock price to become artificially inflated, inflicting damages on investors. Spectranetics develops, manufactures, markets and distributes single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system for use with Spectranetics' excimer laser system. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that their public statements concerning Spectranetics' business and operations were materially false and misleading. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that defendants' public statements failed to disclose or indicate the following: (1) that the Company lacked effective regulatory compliance controls (2) that the Company was illegally and extensively marketing its laser and catheters for uses that had not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") (3) that the Company failed to report to the FDA that tests found its laser caused significant damage to stents it was using in the clinical trial (4) that the Company illegally tested several products on patients without FDA approval (5) that the Company lacked effective internal controls and (6) as a result of the above, the Company's financial results were materially inflated. On September 4, 2008, Spectranetics shocked investors when reports surfaced that Federal Officials had served search warrants on the Company and NASDAQ halted trading of Spectranetics' common stock. That evening, Spectranetics issued a press release disclosing that the Company was jointly served by the FDA and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a search warrant relating to the promotion, use, testing, marketing, and sales of certain Spectranetics products, and payments made to medical personnel and an identified institution for this application. The search warrant also requested information about two post-market studies completed during the period from 2002 to 2005 and payments to medical personnel in connection with those studies, as well as information regarding compensation packages for certain Spectranetics personnel. On this news, NASDAQ subsequently halted trading of shares in Spectranetics, but only after Company shares had already fallen $4.27 per share, or 47 percent, to $4.73 per share on unusually heavy trading volume. The following day, September 5, 2008, shares of Spectranetics were allowed to resume trading and closed at $5.63 per share, a decline of $3.37 per share, or 37 percent, from the September 3, 2008 closing price of $9.00 per share.

Specifically, defendants issued false statements concerning strong existing demand for StarTek's outsourced services from four of the Company's customers that accounted for 90% of StarTek's revenue, the Company's healthy sales pipeline and the completion of a management transition and restructuring plan, which artificially inflated StarTek's stock price during the Class Period. On May 6, 2005, StarTek announced that its first quarter 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $0.18 compared to $0.49 for the first quarter of 2004. The Company also announced that its revenues declined 14.2% from the same period in 2004. On this news, StarTek's stock price fell over 18% from a close of $15.20 on May 5, 2005 to $12.40 on May 6, 2005. Two stockholder derivative lawsuits related to these aforementioned claims were also filed against various of our present and former officers and directors on November 16, 2005, and December 22, 2005, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment.

Sunrise provides residential and other services to retirees and elderly persons through facilities it develops and constructs and then manages, often through joint ventures. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, its stock option plans, its compensation practices and its financial results. As a result of these false statements, Sunrise's common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, reaching a high of $39.68 per share on March 29, 2006. The individual defendants took advantage of Sunrise's falsified financial results, the artificial inflation of Sunrise's stock and the manipulation of its stock option plans by selling shares of their Sunrise stock for illegal insider trading proceeds of over $34 million, while Sunrise's top officers pocketed millions more in unjustified bonus payments enhanced in part by Sunrise's falsified profits. The complaint alleges that defendants had previously manipulated the Company's stock option plans so as to enrich themselves by ""backdating"" or ""spring-loading"" the stock options they were granted. The complaint further alleges that on May 9, 2006, Sunrise disclosed a delay in reporting its first quarter 2006 results to allow a review of its financial statements, and on July 31, 2006, Sunrise revealed it would be forced to restate its financial statements going back several years - at least to 1999 - and that its prior financial statements could no longer be relied upon. Sunrise also admitted it could not file current period financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2006 and that when it restated its financial results, at least $100 million of previously reported profits from its joint ventures and real estate sales would be eliminated.

Plaintiff claims that defendants' omissions and material misrepresentations concerning Staar Surgical's business operations and prospects artificially inflated the Company's stock price, inflicting damages on investors. Staar Surgical develops, manufactures and distributes products, including implantable lenses, used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients with cataracts, refractive conditions and glaucoma.  The Complaint alleges that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that their public statements concerning Staar Surgical's implantable lenses ('ICLs') were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose significant problems with the manufacture of these devices. These significant problems included, but were not limited to: (i) methods, facilities and/or controls used for the manufacture, packing and storage of the ICLs that were not in conformance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice and (ii) failure to establish and maintain procedures to assure that valid methods were used to test the raw materials and finished ICL devices.

The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that their public statements concerning STECs business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose: (1) that the Company over sold its largest customer more inventory than it required (2) that, as such, the Company overstated the demand for its ZeusIOPS SSD products (3) that the Company's subsequent revenue and financial results for the following year would be negatively impacted and (4) that, as a result of the above, Defendants' statements during the Class Period lacked a reasonable basis. On November 3, 2009, STEC shocked investors when it announced that one of its largest customers, which accounts for 90 percent of STEC's ZeusIOPS SSD business and which had placed a $120 million order for the second half of 2009, would carry 2009 inventory into 2010, placing STEC's 2010 first quarter results at risk.

Then, through a series of events in late 2002 and early 2003, the Company's complex financing scheme began to unravel as several of these large projects and their liabilities were ""put"" to TECO, moving hundreds of millions of dollars of off-balance sheet debt onto TECO's balance sheet, resulting in the Company taking over a billion dollars in impairment charges and causing the price of its common stock to plummet from a Class Period high of over $28 per share on April 23, 2002 to below $13 per share on February 4, 2003, erasing hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization.

The complaint alleges that in preparation for the Companys February 2005 IPO, defendants conducted a so-called Phase II study of TH-070 on 30 men at Bari University in Italy. Based on the purported success achieved in the Bari Phase II study, the Company completed its $37 million IPO in February 2005, conducted additional clinical trials, filed a new drug application with the FDA in late 2005, and completed the $65 million follow-on offering in October 2005. However, on May 11, 2006, defendants were forced to disclose that the FDA had placed the TH-070 program on partial clinical hold as a result of abnormalities observed in liver enzyme levels in six subjects in ongoing clinical trials and had requested that the Company provide additional information related to the drugs acceptable dose and duration of treatment in BPH patients. According to the complaint, while defendants had known for years of TH-070s propensity to cause liver toxicity, the IPO and follow-on offering prospectuses concealed it. Then, on July 17, 2006, the Company was forced to concede that TH-070 provided no benefit whatsoever in the alleviation of prostate enlargement and that Threshold planned to discontinue development of TH-070 for BPH altogether.

Plaintiffs shall have 30 days from the date of this order to file an amended complaint. The original complaint charges Thoratec and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company claims that its HeartMate XVE (""HeartMate"") is an approved ventricular assist device designed to provide permanent support for these patients. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made a number of false and misleading statements regarding expected sales and the market for the HeartMate as a ""Destination Therapy"" treatment for end-stage heart failure patients. As a result of these statements, Thoratec's stock traded at artificially inflated levels and defendants were able to complete a $143.7 million note offering.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants knew but concealed from the investing public the following adverse material facts: (i) even as the Company estimated that as many as 100,000 patients per year in the U.S. could be helped by their new Destination Therapy treatment option, the actual ""true"" market for the product was far less than claimed, as it was severely constrained by limited reimbursement dollars available under Medicare and Medicaid service guidelines (ii) although the defendants claimed that there were approximately 900 hospital centers in the U.S. qualified for the practice of Destination Therapy and implantation of the HeartMate, in fact less than 75 centers have been designated as Medicare-approved for Destination Therapy (iii) Medicare had rigid preset reimbursement guidelines and schedules for Destination Therapy that could only translate into a serious negative impact on the Company's FY2004 sales projections for the HeartMate (iv) cardiothorasic surgeons were rejecting and/or not accepting the HeartMate as a viable device for Destination Therapy patients because of issues with the device's reliability in a long-term setting (v) the demand for the Company's Destination Therapy implants was not growing at the rate claimed (vi) the Company's Destination Therapy implant estimate for FY2004 of between 300 to 500 pumps was grossly overstated and was internally projected to be a fraction of this estimate (vii) the Company's FY2004 projections of $190-$200 million were overstated by tens of millions of dollars (viii) not only were CMS reimbursement charges delaying the number of implants, implantation centers and medical professionals had delayed any significant expansion of the existing implant programs until after October 1, 2004 (the expected date of the availability of a significant increase in the CMS reimbursement rate) and (ix) sales of the HeartMate implants would be depressed until Q4 2004, and as a result, the Company's earnings shortfall experienced in Q1 2004 (versus Q4 2003 and Q1 2003) would not be made up for nearly one year, until Q1 2005, at best.

According to the complaint, Tellabs had represented to the public, in press releases issued throughout the Class Period, that its new products were enjoying strong demand, that the seeming slowdown in its business was due to ""component-parts shortages which have been corrected"" and that Tellabs' business was strong fundamentally and the Company would meet earnings and revenues expectations. The complaint alleges that these, and other, statements were materially false and misleading because, as alleged in the complaint, Tellabs' new optical networking line of products were inferior to the competition and its products were not well-received or in high demand. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to Defendants' statements to the investing public, the Company's highly-touted acquisition of SALIX was a failure as sales of the product line Tellabs gained in the acquisition were falling. On June 19, 2002, Tellabs issued a press release revealing that second quarter of 2001 revenues would be 35% less than guidance reiterated only weeks before, and that the Company's earnings would be breakeven instead of the consensus $0.29 per share. In reaction to the announcement, the price of Tellabs' common stock fell by 31%, from $23 per share on June 19 to $15.87 on June 20, representing a 75% decline from the Class Period high. During the Class Period, Defendant Tellabs Chairman sold a total of 80,000 shares of Tellabs common stock at prices between $64.25 to $65.38 per share, grossing proceeds of more than $5.18 million. As summarized by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, nine actions were subsequently consolidated, and on December 3, 2002, a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed against Tellabs and certain its of its current or former officers and/or directors.  The consolidated amended complaint alleged that during the class period (December 11, 2000-June 19, 2001) the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements, including, among other things, allegedly providing revenue forecasts that were false and misleading, misrepresenting demand for the Companys products, and reporting overstated revenues for the fourth quarter 2000 in the Companys financial statements.  Further, certain of the individual defendants were alleged to have violated the federal securities laws by trading the Company??s securities while allegedly in possession of material, non-public information about the Company pertaining to these matters. On January 17, 2003, Tellabs and the other named defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety.  On May 19, 2003, the Court granted the Company??s motion and dismissed all counts of the consolidated amended complaint, while affording plaintiffs an opportunity to replead.  On July 11, 2003, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended class action complaint against Tellabs and many (although not all) of the other previously named individual defendants, realleging claims similar to those contained in the previously dismissed consolidated amended class action complaint.  The Company filed a second m""on to dismiss on August 22, 2003, seeking the dismissal with prejudice of all claims alleged in the second consolidated amended class action complaint.  On February 19, 2004, the Court issued an order granting that motion and dismissed the action with prejudice.  On March 18, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Federal Court of Appeal for the Seventh Circuit, appealing the dismissal.  The appeal was fully briefed and oral argument was heard on January 21, 2005.  On January 25, 2006, the Seventh Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the judgment of the district court, and remanding for further proceedings.  On February 8, 2006, defendants filed with the Seventh Circuit a petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc.  On April 19, 2006, the Seventh Circuit ordered plaintiffs to file an answer to the petition for rehearing, which was filed by the plaintiffs on May 3, 2006.  On July 10, 2006, the Seventh Circuit denied the petition for rehearing with a minor modification to its opinion. According to the Company??s FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 30, 2007, on September 22, 2006, defendants filed a motion in the district court to dismiss some (but not all) of the remaining claims. On October 3, 2006, the defendants filed with the United States Supreme Court a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking to appeal the Seventh Circuit??s decision. On January 5, 2007, the defendants?? petition was granted. The United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on March 28, 2007. According to a press release dated June 21, 2007, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of Tellabs Inc. in a class-action case, setting a tougher standard for investors pursuing lawsuits alleging that corporations engaged in securities fraud. In an 8-1 ruling, the court said plaintiffs' attorneys must show when filing suit that corporate executives had a ""ent and compelling"" intent to engage in wrongdoing. Courts must weigh other innocent explanations for conduct alleged in fraud suits, the court said in an opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The decision vacates an appellate court ruling that had set a lower standard. The case now goes back to the lower court. Tellabs (TLAB), a telecommunications equipment maker, welcomed the decision. ""We are encouraged that the Supreme Court recognized that the Seventh Circuit's decision was incorrect,"" said James M. Sheehan, the company's general counsel. ""The Supreme Court has also appropriately established a strict standard to be applied in sending the case back for further review."" Sheehan said Tellabs was confident the lawsuit would ultimately be found to be without merit. The class-action lawsuit was filed in 2001 after a sharp plunge in Tellabs' revenue and stock price.  According to a press release dated January 18, 2008, the most important United States Supreme Court decision in the field of securities litigation in 2007 received a significant postscript today when the appellate court to which the case was remanded determined that the securities fraud complaint at issue was sufficient to allow full litigation to proceed against the defendants. In Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S.Ct. 2499 (2007), the Supreme Court announced a uniform standard for evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and sent the case back to the Seventh Circuit to rule on the sufficiency of the complaint under the new standard. Milberg Weiss LLP In the decision issued today, the Seventh Circuit again reviewed the complaint, and concluded that ""the plaintiffs have succeeded, with regard to the statements identified in our previous opinion as having been adequately alleged to be false and material, in pleading scienter in conformity with the requirements of the PSLRA. We therefore adhere to our decision to reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing the suit."" The unanimous decision was written by Judge Richard A. Posner. On February 13, 2008, a mandate from the United States Court of Appeals was entered reversing the lower court??s decision to dismiss. As a result, the case has been remanded back to the District Court. On March 17, 2008, a renewed motion was filed seeking dismissal of Count V of the complaint relating to Tellabs claims of insider trading by the CEO and all claims based on channel stuffing and statements regarding the TITAN 6500 f",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES,1,0,0,0,0

In March 2007, the parties agreed to stay further discovery in the case with the Courts approval pending a mediation designed to reach a settlement resolving the lawsuit. The parties conducted a mediation in April 2007, and subsequently entered into a settlement agreement in February 2008. The settlement agreement provides for a cash settlement payment of $3.6 million to be paid by the Companys insurer and payment of expenses of plaintiffs lead counsel not to exceed $50,000. In exchange for the cash settlement payment and expense payment, the Company and all defendants would be released from all claims of class members relating to the action. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement of the parties by an order entered on April 1, 2008, and subsequently granted final approval of the settlement agreement after a fairness hearing on June 20, 2008.

Toll Brothers is a home builder which specializes in building large, expensive homes. Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants made a series of false and misleading statements indicating that Toll Brothers business model, which was based on developing expensive homes for a niche market of high-end buyers, was unique and thus immune from the adverse impact of rising interest rates and other negative macro-economic factors that appeared to be negatively impacting the home-building industry during 2004 and 2005. As the truth was revealed to investors, including the deteriorating state of demand for Toll Brothers homes, its constrained and shrinking number of active selling communities, the insufficient inventory of lots for Toll Brothers to achieve 20% net income growth in 2006 and 2007, and the actual adverse impact of rising interest rates and negative macro-economic trends on traffic to Toll Brothers communities and demand for its homes and thus its future prospects, Toll Brothers stock plummeted, falling from its $58.25 per share Class Period high in July 2005 to as low as $33.72 per share on November 9, 2005, a 42% drop.

The defendants made misleading statements between December 2004 and November 2005 regarding the current and future conditions of Toll Brothers and failed to disclose adverse developments that were negatively impacting the business, the plaintiffs said in the 2007 complaint.

The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose the following adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them: (i) that the Companys Well Abandonment and Decommissioning (WA&D) division was not performing according to internal expectations (ii) that the Company failed to timely take a charge for insurance receivables which remain uncollected and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company and its prospects. On August 3, 2007, the Company announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2007 and reduced its full year 2007 earnings guidance because of, among other things, poor profits at its WA&D services. Shares of TETRA stock fell 25% following this announcement. Then, on October 16, 2007, TETRA issued a press release announcing that it was withdrawing its previously estimated full year 2007 earnings guidance because of, among other things, the Companys concern that it would have to take a charge to earnings for substantial uncollected insurance receivables.

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Textron failed to disclose that the V-22 Osprey, a military aircraft that it was manufacturing, suffered from structural defects that required that it be substantially redesigned which would delay full-scale production of the Osprey for years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in excess of the costs allocated to the project for the purpose of calculating profit and loss.

Tyco's payment will be the largest cash payment ever made by a corporate defendant in the history of securities litigation, the judge said. In total, the settlement agreement is the third-largest class action recovery ever, behind the deals in Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc., he said. Under the agreement, Tyco will pay $2.975 billion to investors. Tyco auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which was also named as a defendant in the suit, will pay another $225 million. Judge Barbadoro said that 28 objections, four which were from institutional investors, were filed against the proposed settlement. ??In light of the substantial risk, uncertainty and delay associated with proceeding to summary judgment and trial, the $3.2 billion settlement amount is an outstanding recovery for the class,?? he said. He als""igned off on paying plaintiffs' firms Grant & Eisenhofer PA, Milberg Weiss LLP and Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler LLP $460 million with an additional $29 million in expenses. In a press release dated July 6, 2007, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (""PwC"") has agreed to pay $225 million to settle securities and accounting fraud claims relating to the Tyco International Ltd. securities class action , presently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire before Judge Paul Barbadoro. This settlement with PwC, combined with the recent settlement with Tyco - the largest ever by a single corporate defendant - will bring the total settlement to more than $3.2 billion by the time it is presented to the court for final distribution, inclusive of interest. The settlement with PwC, reached after four years of hard-fought litigation and extensive mediation, represents one of the largest recoveries on record from an outside auditor in the history of securities class action litigation. Investors who purchased or acquired Tyco securities from December 13, 1999 through and including June 7, 2002 are covered by the settlement. In a press release dated May 15, 2007, Tyco International Ltd. has agreed to immediately fund $2.975 billion in cash to settle securities and accounting fraud claims relating to the Kozlowski era which are presently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire before Judge Paul Barbadoro. The settlement specifically excludes auditor PriceWaterhouseCoopers (""PwC"") and, by the time the settlement will be presented to the Court for final distribution, it will exceed $3 billion in value, inclusive of interest. The settlement represents the single largest payment from any corporate defendant in the history of securities class action litigation. Investors who purchased or acquired Tyco securities from December 13, 1999 through and including June 7, 2002, are covered by the settlement. & As part of the settlement, Tyco has agreed to assign the claims it has against PwC related to the accounting fraud to the Class, which intends to vigorously pursue both its own claims and the assigned claims. As Tyco's auditor, PwC was in a unique position to uncover the fraud and to prevent the damages to Tyco's shareholders. Instead, PwC is alleged to have failed in its duties as a corporate watchdog. In addition, as Tyco already has its own claims being pursued against certain of the individual defendants, the Class has assigned its claims against Dennis Kozlowski, Frank Walsh and Mark Swartz to Tyco in exchange for receiving a 50% interest in any net recoveries achieved against these non-settling defendants. As summarized by the Companys FORM 10-Q For the Quarterly Period Ended March 30, 2007, most of the securities class actions have now been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. On January 28, 2003, a consolidated securities class action complaint was filed in these proceedings. On January 7, 2005, we answered the plaintiffs' ""onsolidated complaint. On January 14, 2005, lead plaintiffs made a motion for class certification, which we opposed on July 22, 2005. On July 5, 2005, we moved for revision of the court's October 14, 2004 order in light of a change in law, insofar as the order denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to plead loss causation. On December 2, 2005, the court denied our motion. On April 4, 2006, plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary judgment that was denied without prejudice to its later renewal. On June 12, 2006, the court entered an order certifying a class ""consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Tyco securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002, and who were damaged thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and partners thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest."" On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On September 22, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied our petition. On July 6, 2006, the lead plaintiffs filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire a motion for a permanent injunction against prosecution of the class action styled Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd. that was certified by the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois. On October 26, 2006, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief without prejudice. In August 2002, by the Order from the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, the pending class actions from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York were transferred to the District of New Hampshire, case number 02-MD-1335. The class action complaints filed against TYCO in several U.S. District Courts alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market during the Class Period, thereby artificially inflating the price of TYCO common stock. The complaint filed in the US District Court South District of New York alleges that TYCO's representations were rendered false and misleading by defendants' failure to disclose: (a) that TYCO would achieve its earnings targets only through undisclosed acquisitions (b) that the individual defendants sold in excess of $100,000,000 of their individual stock holdings to the company and (c) that TYCO's management procedures were to make large payments to insiders, including a $20,000,000 payment to one director and his charity for furthering the interests of TYCO. It further alleges that external rule changes required TYCO to cease its allegedly aggressive revenue recognition practices and recognize the revenues from its security contracts only as the monies thereunder were received. Throughout the Class Period, defendants were allegedly aware that the adverse financial effect of the rule change by the Securities and Exchange Commission would be approximately $1,000,000,000. However, defendants allegedly failed to disclose this adverse financial effect until partial disclosure was made in October 2001. As defendants belatedly announced portions of the foregoing material facts between October 2001 and January 2002, TYCO stock fell allegedly by more than 40 plus percent. The complaint filed in the in the US District Court of New Hampshire asserts claims that Defendants issued various affirmative statements regarding the Company's ability to conduct an offering of stock for its subsidiary CIT Group which were false and misleading given Defendants' failure to disclose the material adverse risk that they would not be able to complete this offering, or, if they did, would not be able to do so on favorable terms, once the criminal investigation of Kozlowski became publicly known.

On June 19, 2007, the Parties presented to the District Court a proposed Stipulation of Settlement between Lead Plaintiffs and Defendants.

The appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In a press release dated February 19, 2004, Judge Milton Pollack of United States District Court in New York threw out the suit. The investors ""ed to assert any causal relationship between the 'fraud' alleged and the decline in the trading price of Tyco's securities,'' Judge Pollack said in a ruling.

According to the complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court (03cv4080)(Sweet, J.), Young issued numerous misleading research reports on Tyco while supposedly working as an ""independent"" Merrill Lynch managing director. Young voiced opinions in his research reports on Tyco that were flatly contradicted in his own private emails, where he expressed his true outlook on Tyco. For example, Young's emails, which turned up in the NASD's investigation of him, show that he didn't believe his own publicly-issued research reports concluding that Tyco's subsidiary, CIT Group, could be sold for as high as $7-8 billion. Young privately expressed his true view that CIT would fetch much less, if a buyer could be found at all. In other emails, Young made it plain that Tyco ""effectively bought and paid for"" him as the complaint alleges (paragraph 3), when he candidly described himself in a private email as ""LOYAL TYCO EMPLOYEE."" Young routinely sent his draft Tyco research reports to Tyco's Investor Relations Department for review, comment and editing. And with respect to one of his reports, Young asked Tyco: ""did I not sound pumped up enough?"" Young is also accused of passing insider tips to his institutional clients in advance of at least one Tyco deal involving Siemens and accepting unlawful gifts from Tyco.ptcy  fo",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE (ANALYSTS' MALPRACTICES),0,1,0,0,0

According to the Notice Of Pendency And Proposed Settlement Of Class Action dated August 1, 2006, the total proposed settlement fund is in the amount of Fund: Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) in cash. A settlement hearing is scheduled on November 2, 2006, to determine whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. As disclosed by the Company??s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, AMERCO is a defendant in a consolidated putative class action lawsuit entitled ??In Re AMERCO Securities Litigation??, United States District Court, Case No. CV-N-03-0050-ECR (RAM). The action alleges claims for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 there under, section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The action alleges, among other things, that AMERCO engaged in transactions with the SAC entities that falsely improved AMERCO??s financial statements and that AMERCO failed to disclose the transactions properly. The action has been transferred to the United States District Court, District of Arizona and assigned to Judge Bryan. Motions to Dismiss are fully briefed and are before the court. Prior to the ruling on the Motions to Di"", the parties have agreed to a settlement in principle, subject to final documentation and approval by the Court. The settlement in the amount of $5.0 million will be covered by AMERCO??s D&O insurance carrier. The complaint alleges that Amerco and certain of its officers and directors violated the federal securities laws by issuing false and misleading statements during the Class Period. During the Class Period, Defendants caused Amerco to engage in transactions with SAC Holding Corporation and SAC Holding Corporation II (hereinafter ""AC Holdings""), which falsely improved Amerco's financials, and which served to benefit Amerco insiders to the detriment of Amerco shareholders. Defendants failed to disclose the true nature and financial impact of the transactions to the public.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Amerco failed to disclose that Defendants used Amerco's resources to identify, purchase, and/or develop self-storage properties, which it then sold to SAC Holdings for inadequate consideration or caused SAC Holdings to buy. SAC Holdings, owned and controlled by Amerco insiders, thereby received substantial benefit from transactions which otherwise served to falsely improve Amerco's financials. On September 26, 2002, Amerco restated its 2002 financial results in an amended 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2002, and restated its 2001 and 2000 financials for the second time. As a result of the defendants' false and misleading statements during the Class Period, Amerco's stock price was artificially inflated, averaging approximately $18 per share.

Specifically, defendants misrepresented and omitted material facts concerning UnitedHealth's backdating of stock option grants to defendants the Companys CEO and the Companys COO. UnitedHealth represented that the exercise price of all stock options would be no less than the fair market value of UnitedHealth's common stock, measured by the publicly traded closing price for UnitedHealth stock on the day of the grant. However, in reality, those options were backdated so their exercise price correlated to a day on or near the day UnitedHealth stock hit its low price for the year, or directly in advance of sharp increases in the price of UnitedHealth stock. Defendants the Companys CEO and the Companys COO have collectively earned over $500 million by exercising these backdated options. As the truth concerning United Health's practice of backdating option grants became known to the market from a variety of sources, the price of UnitedHealth stock fell $6.76, or 12%, over several trading sessions. The lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of UnitedHealth Group, Inc. during the Class Period, and also  included are all those who acquired UnitedHealth's securities through its acquisitions of AmeriChoice, Mid Atlantic Medical, Oxford Health Plans and Pacificare Health.

On December 8, 2006, a consolidated amended complaint was filed consolidating the actions into a single action. The action is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated PSLRA Litigation. The action was brought by lead plaintiff California Public Employees Retirement System against the Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that defendants, in connection with the same alleged course of conduct identified in the shareholder derivative actions described above, made misrepresentations and omissions during the period between January 20, 2005 and May 17, 2006, in press releases and public filings that artificially inflated the price of our common stock. The consolidated amended complaint also asserts that during the class period, certain defendants sold shares of our common stock while in possession of material, non-public information concerning the matters set forth in the complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a) and 20A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11 and 15 of the 1933 Act. The action seeks unspecified money damages and equitable relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February 6, 2007. The motion to dismiss was denied in an order filed on June 4, 2007 and discovery is ongoing. On July 18, 2007, the lead plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the Companys liability on the Section 11 claim. The court denied the motion for partial summary judgment on October 2, 2007. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and the case is currently scheduled to be ready for trial in July 2008.  As summarized by the Companys Form 10-Q For The Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2008, on March 18, 2008, the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On July 2, 2008, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiff CalPERS and plaintiff class representative Alaska Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry Pension Trust, on behalf of themselves and members of the class, to settle the lawsuit. The proposed settlement will fully resolve all claims against the Company, all current officers and directors of the Company named in the lawsuit, and certain former officers and directors of the Company named in the lawsuit. No parties admit any wrongdoing as part of the proposed settlement. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company has paid $895 million into a settlement fund for the benefit of class members. In addition to the payment to the settlement fund, the Company will also supplement the substantial changes it has already implemented in its corporate governance policies with additional changes and enhancements.

On January 9, 2004, the Lead Plaintiff filed its consolidated amended complaint on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of UnumProvident stock between March 30, 2000 and April 24, 2003. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company issued misleading financial statements, improperly accounted for certain impaired investments, failed to properly estimate the Company??s disability claim reserves, and pursued certain improper claims handling practices. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

The Company  failed to properly record the impairment to its investments and operated  ""long-term denial factories,"" causing the Company's financial results to  be inflated. As a result, the Company's shares traded at inflated prices  enabling UnumProvident to raise proceeds of $250 million on June 13,  2002 in its bond offering.

As the Complaint details, on August 30, 2004, United Rentals announced that it had received notice that the SEC was conducting a non-public, fact- finding inquiry of the company. The notice was accompanied by a subpoena requesting the production of documents relating to certain of the Company's accounting records. News of this inquiry shocked the market. Shares of United Rentals fell $4.39 per share, or 21.53 percent, to close at $16.00 per share on August 30, 2004 on unusually heavy trading volume. As summarized by the Companys FORM 10-K For The Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008, as previously announced, following our public announcement of the SEC inquiry, three purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and/or directors in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. By orders dated February 1, 2005 and November 8, 2005, the Court consolidated the three actions and appointed City of Pontiac Policemans and Firemans Retirement System as lead plaintiff for the purported class. The consolidated action is now entitled In re United Rentals, Inc. Securities Litigation. The consolidated amended complaint in this action alleges, among other things, that certain of our SEC filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements that resulted in damages to the plaintiffs and the members of the purported class when they purchased our securities. The consolidated amended complaint includes, inter alia, allegations relating to the conclusions of the Special Committee and other matters disclosed in the 2004 Form 10-K. On the basis of those allegations, lead plaintiff, on behalf of itself and a purported class of purchasers of our securities from February 28, 2001 to August 30, 2004, asserts: (i) a claim against all defendants under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ??Exchange Act??), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and (ii) a claim against certain of the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

More specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants misrepresented material adverse facts during the Class Period, including, but not limited to: (a) significant problems with the Company's internal controls (b) problems related to the Company's revenue recognition polices and procedures and (c) supply chain problems that delayed recognition of certain revenues. On September 16, 2004, UTStarcom filed its second-quarter 2004 financial results with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating, among other things, that a Company-initiated review of a $290 million contract with Japan Telecom Co., Ltd. led management to conclude that certain significant control deficiencies exist related to the review and evaluation of criteria related to revenue recognition. Four days later, on September 20, 2004, UTStarcom announced that the Company was revising its financial guidance downward for third-quarter and full-year 2004 and, moreover, would defer recognition of the entire $290-million Japan Telecom contract, rather than recognize revenue of $220 million in the second half of 2004.

However, in reality, options granted in 2002 were backdated so their exercise price correlated to a day on or near the day UTStarcom's stock hit a significantly low price for the year, or directly in advance of sharp increases in the price of UTStarcom stock. The complaint further alleges that the truth regarding the Company's option granting practices was revealed on July 24, 2007. On that date, UTStarcom announced that a review of the Company's historical stock option grant practices uncovered evidence that stock option grants were backdated. As a result of these findings, the Company further announced that its previously issued financial statements for the years 2000 through 2006 should no longer be relied upon, and would be restated by at least $28 million.

The Company provides broadband telephone services in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, primarily using voice over Internet protocol technology. Prior to the Company's Initial Public Offering (""IPO"") on May 24, 2006, the Company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to market its services to potential customers. However, the Complaint alleges, both the Company and Company insiders, who had invested hundreds of millions of dollars of their personal funds in the Company, were losing money. According to the Complaint, these Company insiders, desperate to execute an exit strategy for themselves, embarked on an illegal course of conduct to sell shares of the Company in a public market. The Complaint further alleges that, Defendants, realizing that institutional investors who normally buy in IPOs would be reluctant at best to purchase Vonage shares as-priced, pre-sold at least 13.5% of the Company's IPO shares to Company customers in violation of NASD Rule 2310. NASD Rule 2310 requires that a company recommending the purchase or sale of its securities to a customer must have a reasonable basis for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer. The Complaint also alleges Defendants had no such reasonable basis in this case and improperly crammed investors into the Vonage IPO regardless of their suitability. The Complaint also contends that the Underwriter Defendants violated the securities laws because they allowed this illegal and improper action to continue. The Underwriter Defendants, the Plaintiff claims, had an obligation to ensure that Vonage had complied with NASD Rule 2310 in setting up and administering the accounts of customers purchasing in the IPO. According to the Complaint, however, the Underwriter Defendants had little or no incentive to ensure that customer participants in the IPO were suitable. Instead, the Complaint also alleges they were motivated by the tens of millions of dollars in fees they would receive from a successful IPO. Furthermore, according to the Complaint, Vonage had agreed to indemnify the Underwriter Defendants against certain liabilities relating to the customer pre-sale program among those liabilities was the foreseeable possibility that customers who purchased in the IPO would refuse or fail to pay for the common stock allocated to them in the pre-sale. As a result of this alleged illegal conduct, shares of Vonage sold in the IPO declined more than 30% in the first seven trading days. The decline in value of these shares has been substantially exacerbated by many Vonage customers who participated in the pre-sale now refusing to pay for their shares. According to the Companys Form 10-Q For the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2006, during June 2006 and July 2006, Vonage, several of its officers and directors, and the firms who served as the underwriters in Vonages IPO were named as defendants in Lang v. Vonage Holdings Corp. et al., a purported class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Subsequently, several similar purported class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, one was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and another was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaints assert claims under the federal securities laws on behalf of a professed class consisting of all those who were allegedly damaged as a result of acquiring the Companys common stock in connection with its IPO. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Company omitted and/or misstated certain facts concerning the IPOs Customer Directed Share Program. Some complaints also allege the IPO prospectus contained misrepresentations or omissions concerning certain of its products and/or the prior experience of some of its management. One complaint (Inouye v. Vonage Holdings Corp. et al.), which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and subsequently voluntarily dismissed, included an allegation of open market securities fraud during a purported class period of May 24, 2006 to June 19, 2006 in addition to claims arising out of the IPO.

The court previously approved a settlement in the case in Nov. 15, 2005. However, a shareholder appealed the approval of the plan allocation, among other things. In a press release dated August 6, 2007, notice of a proposed $35 million settlement of class securities charges over an alleged financial fraud scheme at Veritas Software Corp. did not meet 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act requirements, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded July 25, resolving a question of first impression (In re Veritas Software Corp. Securities Litigation (Petrone v. Malone), 9th Cir., Nos. 05-17393, 06-15435, 7/25/07). Vacating and remanding, the appeals court said the estimated $0.25 per share recovery set forth in the notice was based on the ""undisclosed assumption that only a fraction of class members""--43 percent--""would actually file claims."" On March 9, 2006, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal as to the Order on the Motion for Attorney Fees.  By the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, signed on November 15, 2005, by U.S. District Judge Maxine M. Chesney, the Court approves the settlement set forth in the Stipulation, certifies the Settlement Class, and discharges all Released Claims against all Released Persons. In a press release dated April 8, 2005,  Veritas Software Corp., which is being acquired by Symantec Corp., has set aside $35 million to settle a class-action lawsuit, according to a twice-delayed filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. In its annual report, the Mountain View, Calif.-based storage software maker said a U.S. court on March 18 tentatively approved a settlement of suits that accused Veritas officers and directors of making misleading statements about the firm's fiscal results in 2000, 2001 and 2002. On July 21, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint and the defendants responded by filing motions to dismiss the Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On December 10, 2003, the Court entered the Order granting the motions to dismiss with leave to amend.  On January 16, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint and the defendants responded by filing motions to dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint.  On May 19, 2004, the Court entered the Order granting the motions to dismiss with leave to amend.  On June 30, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint and the defendants responded by filing motions to dismiss.  On January 20, 2005, a letter was filed in the Court advising the Court that the case has settled through mediation conducted on January 18, 2005.  On February 18, 2005, a Stipulation of Settlement was filed. The original complaint charges VERITAS and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. VERITAS is a software storage company that provides data protection, storage management and disaster recovery software. The complaint alleges that on January 17, 2003, the Company announced the restatement of its 2000 and 2001 financial statements as a result of its improper accounting for transactions with AOL Time Warner in 2000. The release stated in part: ""(t)he transactions involved in a $50 million software purchase by AOL and a $20 million advertising services purchase from AOL."" While VERITAS' financial statements were admittedly false and its stock price artificially inflated, the Company's top officers and directors took advantage of this and sold nearly $15 million worth of their VERITAS shares to the unsuspecting public.

Warner Chilcott Limited et al.,"" a class-action suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Subsequently, similar purported class action lawsuits were filed.  On April 25, 2008, the company reached an agreement in principle to settle the class-action lawsuit.  The terms of the settlement, which are subject to negotiation of definitive documentation and must be approved by the court, include a cash payment of $16,500,000, which is expected to be made to the plaintiffs during 2008.  The majority of the settlement will be funded by insurance proceeds and it will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is engaged in the development, manufacture, sale, and marketing of branded prescription pharmaceutical products in women's healthcare and dermatology primarily in the United States. Specifically, the complaint alleges the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO contained untrue statements of material facts, omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and was not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing its preparation. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the Registration Statement failed to disclose that at the time of the IPO, Warner Chilcott had ceased shipments of Ovcon 35, its top selling birth control pill, thereby eliminating a primary revenue stream for the Company. The complaint further alleges that on or around September 26, 2006, Warner Chilcott announced developments in a lawsuit brought against it by the Federal Trade Commission and filed a supplement to the Registration Statement in which it disclosed that, among other things, it had ceased shipments of Ovcon 35 in September 2006 when it launched Ovcon Chewable. In response to these disclosures the price of Warner Chilcott common stock dropped from $15.00 per share to $12.60 per share on extremely heavy trading volume.

Had the negative information been disclosed, the market price of Weatherford stock would have been much lower. Absent the failure to disclose this negative information, plaintiffs would not have purchased Weatherford stock or warrants or they would have purchased Weatherford stock and warrants at a much lower price. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs paid an artificially inflated price for the Weatherford shares and warrants because defendants omitted to state material facts necessary to make the public statements made by defendants not misleading.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants issued false and misleading statements regarding the Company's ability to grow in the face of any expected interest rate increases, as well as the Company's purported financial hedging strategies. On June 29, 2004, investors learned the truth about the Company after Defendants issued a press release announcing a very significant earnings and net income shortfall which far exceeded any guidance previously sponsored and endorsed by Defendants. According to this release, increases in interest rates had, in fact, impacted the Company's mortgage banking business to such an extent that earnings for the full year were revised to as low as $3.00 per share, compared to the up to $4.80 per share guidance provided at the inception of the Class Period. In addition, Defendants had not properly hedged the Company's interest rate risk such that is was now having a material adverse impact on Washington Mutual, Inc.

WaMu is a financial services company and the largest savings and loan bank in the United States. The Company was founded in 1889 and provides financial products and services to consumers and small to mid-sized businesses. The Company offers consumer banking, mortgage lending, commercial banking, and consumer finance throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business and financial results. WaMus loan portfolio contained more than $57 billion in adjustable-rate mortgages or Option-ARM loans. The complaint further alleges that the Company failed to disclose: (i) that it had far greater exposure to anticipated losses and defaults in its home loan portfolio, particularly with Option-ARMs, than it had previously disclosed (ii) that defendants Class Period statements about the Company undertaking significant preparations and implementing defensive measures to weather the increasingly difficult credit and housing markets were patently false (iii) that defendants had engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to inflate the appraisal value of homes with the intent to artificially increase the estimated loan-to-value ratio of its Option-ARM portfolio and (iv) that due to the Companys improper appraisal practices, the mortgages it had issued were much riskier than represented. According to the complaint, on October 17, 2007, after the market closed, WaMu stunned investors by disclosing that it had suffered a 72% drop in third quarter of 2007 net income and would have to set aside up to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to cover its loan losses.

Williams Communications stock purchasers filed suit in 2002. The plaintiffs contended that company officials did not properly disclose the failing company's true financial condition, and that officials' public statements belied the firm's plummeting fiscal picture. According to the court's 169-page opinion, the defendants argued that the shareholders were not entitled to insurance against ""improvident investment choices.  & The litigation was initially filed against the communications company, Williams Companies and auditors Ernst and Young. A federal court later separated it into two cases. The Williams Companies settled the portion of the litigation against it last year, agreeing to pay $290 million, with another $21 million from Ernst and Young. One of the subclasses (the WMB Subclass) consists of purchasers of securities issued by Williams Companies, Inc.

In a press release dated June 13, 2006, Williams Cos. Inc. (NYSE:WMB) will pay $290 million US to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit, but company officials say the settlement won't slow its recovery from accounting and liability woes. Williams announced the settlement early Tuesday. The settlement covers investors who purchased Williams securities between July 24, 2000, and July 22, 2002.

Williams guaranteed more than $2 billion of that company's debt. Williams Communications later went bankrupt. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan was the court-appointed co-lead plaintiff, with the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, in the class action on behalf of investors who bought Williams securities.

In a press release dated January 14, 2005, Xcel Energy Inc. announced that it has reached settlement of three lawsuits, pertaining to: -- The purported class action securities lawsuits that were brought in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on behalf of persons who purchased Xcel Energy's common stock and/or certain series of Senior Notes of its former subsidiary NRG Energy, Inc., between Jan. 31, 2001, and July 25, 2002 -- Actions brought on behalf of participants in Xcel Energy's and its predecessor companies' 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plans, which alleged violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and which were based on the same general allegations underlying the securities litigation and -- A shareholder derivative action - purportedly on behalf of Xcel Energy and against the directors and certain present and former officers - which cited essentially the same circumstances as the securities litigation and asserted breach of fiduciary duty.  Under terms of the settlements of the securities and ERISA claims, Xcel Energy's insurance carriers have agreed to pay $70.5 million and Xcel Energy will pay $17.5 million. Settlement of the derivative lawsuit involves Xcel Energy's adoption of certain corporate governance measures and payment of plaintiff's attorneys' fees and expenses, of which $125,000 will be paid by Xcel Energy. The securities settlement is dependent upon successful completion of both other settlements, and all three are subject to various conditions, including final approval by the U.S. District Court following notice and hearing. There are no guarantees that the conditions will be met, including that final court approval will be obtained. The settlements include no admission of liability by Xcel Energy or any individual defendants.  The original Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 31, 2001 and July 26, 2002, thereby artificially inflating the price of Xcel Energy securities. Throughout the Class Period, as alleged in the Complaint, defendants issued numerous statements and filed quarterly and annual reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission (""SEC"") which described the Company's financial performance and the financial performance of NRG Energy, Inc.   (""NRG""), the Company's majority-owned subsidiary. As alleged in the Complaint, these statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose and/or misrepresented the following adverse facts, among others: (a) that the Company had engaged in ""round-trip"" energy trades that provided no economic benefit for the Company (b) that Xcel's and NRG's credit agreements with lenders contained cross-default provisions and covenants, the result of which was that in the event of a default by NRG, among other adverse effects, Xcel would lose access to $800 million in credit (c) that the Company lacked the necessary internal controls to adequately monitor the trading of its power and (d) that as a result, the value of the Company's revenues and financial results were materially overstated at all relevant times. After the close of the market on July 25, 2002, Xcel issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter, the period ended June 30, 2002, and disclosed that its earnings had declined and that it was revising its earnings expectations for fiscal 2002. In a conference call the very next day, defendants finally disclosed the true extent of Xcel's liquidity and credit difficulties and its management's inability to effectively remedy such difficulties stemming from the operations of NRG. As reported in several business articles dated July 26, 2002, analysts were horrified to learn that the liquidity and credit difficulties extended to Xcel itself under the ""cross-collateral default"" provisions Xcel and NRG had entered into with lenders. Market reaction to these revelations was swift and brutal. On July 26, 2002, Xcel stock closed at $7.55, a more than 36% one-day decline, on extremely heavy trading volume. Subsequently, on July 28, 2002, defendants disclosed that Xcel was being investigated by the SEC, among other regulators, for engaging in  ""round-trip"" or ""wash"" transactions, which involve the simultaneous buying and trading of power at the same price and same amount and provide no economic benefit to the Company.

Zobel at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, One Courthouse Way, Courtroom 12, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, for the purpose of determining: (1) whether the proposed settlement of the claims in the litigation described in the detailed Notice of Pendency and Settlement of Class Action (the Notice) for the sum of $3,600,000 in cash (the Settlement Fund) should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable and adequate (2) whether, thereafter, this litigation should be dismissed with prejudice as set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement dated as of November 3, 2008 (the Stipulation) (3) whether the plan of allocation is fair, reasonable and adequate and therefore should be approved and (4) whether the application of Plaintiffs Counsel for the payment of attorneys fees and expenses incurred in connection in this litigation should be approved.  The judge entered a preliminary approval order and set a fairness hearing for February 25, 2008. On November 5, parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement.  The deal involves a $3,600,000 cash payment, paid through Xerium's D&O insurance policy, to the class in exchange for dismissal of claims against it and its officers. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on December 8, 2006, which was denied in May 2007.  The defendants then provided an answer to the complaint a""ainst them on June 8, 2007.  Discovery continues as of August 20, 2008. On September 22, 2006, the Court entered the Order appointing lead plaintiff and approving selection of lead and liaison counsel.  On November 3, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint. The complaint charges Xerium and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Act. Xerium engages in the manufacture and supply of consumable products used in the production of paper. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the Prospectus and Registration Statement (the ""Prospectus"") issued in connection with the Company's Initial Public Offering (""IPO"") on or about May 16, 2005, contained untrue statements of material facts, omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and was not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing its preparation. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, at the time of the IPO, Xerium was undergoing ""Cost Reduction Programs"" which were negatively impacting its business and forcing it to have customers seek out other producers. Among other things, the Prospectus purported to warn about the potential negative impact of these programs but failed to disclose that the Company's business was then being negatively impacted by ",FAILURE OF DISCLOSURE (NON-ACCOUNTING),0,0,0,1,0

Attorneys were awarded $120 million in fees and reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $3,314,399.90. According to a press release dated March 28, 2008, Xerox Corp. said it will pay $670 million, and KPMG LLP will pay $80 million, to settle an eight-year-old securities lawsuit filed on behalf of Xerox investors who claimed Xerox committed accounting fraud to meet Wall Street earnings expectations. Xerox said it agreed to settle without admitting to any wrongdoing. On July 18, 2007, the Court entered an order denying plaintiffs motion for class certification, without prejudice to renewal after the Court holds a pre-filing conference to identify factual disputes the Court will be required to resolve in ruling on the motion. The parties are presently engaged in discovery.  According to the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, on July 13, 2005, the court denied the motion to dismiss the third consolidated amended complaint. On October 31, 2005, the defendants answered the complaint. On January 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. That motion has not been fully briefed or argued before the court. The parties are engaged in discovery.  As disclosed in the same SEC filing, on September 11, 2002, the court entered an endorsement order granting plaintiffs motion to file a third consolidated amended complaint. The defendants motion to dismiss the second consolidated amended complaint was denied, as moot. According to the third consolidated amended complaint, plaintiffs purport to bring this case as a class action on behalf of an expanded class consisting of all persons and/or entities who purchased Xerox common stock and/or bonds during the period between February 17, 1998 through June 28, 2002 and who were purportedly damaged thereby (Class). The third consolidated amended complaint sets forth two claims: one alleging that each of the Company, KPMG, and the individual defendants violated Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 thereunder the other alleging that the individual defendants are also allegedly liable as controlling persons of the Company pursuant to Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants participated in a fraudulent scheme that operated as a fraud and deceit on purchasers of the Companys common stock and bonds by disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts relating to various of the Companys accounting and reporting practices and financial condition. The plaintiffs further allege that this scheme deceived the investing public regarding the true state of the Companys financial condition and caused the plaintiffs and other members of the alleged Class to purchase the Companys common stock and bonds at artificially inflated prices, and prompted a SEC investigation that led to the April 11, 2002 settlement which, among other things, required the Company to pay a $10 penalty and restate its financials for the years 1997-2000 (including restatement of financials previously corrected in an earlier restatement which plaintiffs contend was improper). The third consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages in favor of the plaintiffs and the other Class members against all defendants, jointly and severally, including interest thereon, together with reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees. On December 2, 2002, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The original complaint charges defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint alleges that the defendants issued materially false and misleading information regarding Xerox's financial condition and prospects, particularly that it was successfully addressing its domestic operational problems and was experiencing strong growth in its Mexican operations for the fourth quarter of 1999.

A hearing will be held before the Honorable Ed Kinkeade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, United States Courthouse, 1100 Commerce Street, Dallas, Texas 75242, at 10:00 a.m., on June 16, 2008 to determine whether: (1) the proposed settlement should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable and adequate (2) Co-Lead Counsels application for an award of attorneys fees and reimbursement of expenses should be approved (3) the application of the Lead Plaintiffs for their reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages) relating to their representation of the Class should be approved and (4) the claims against Defendants should be dismissed with prejudice. On September 26, 2006, the Court entered the Memorandum Opinion and Order signed by U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint. According to the Order, the Court finds that Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a Section 10(b) fraud claim against Defendants with the requisite particularity. Further, Plaintiff's complaint also sufficiently alleges a Section 20(a) claim against Defendants with the requisite notice.  The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the Memorandum Opinion and Order was denied on February 25, 2007. On January 27, 2006, the Court entered the Order dismissing the case without prejudice as to two individual defendants pursuant to the notice of voluntary dismissal filed by the lead plaintiffs. As disclosed by the Companys FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, beginning in early September 2004, several purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. These several class action lawsuits have been consolidated into one case. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuits pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and also pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.  The original complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants Zix and certain of its officers and directors disseminated materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys business and prospects. The defendants concealed from the investing public the following facts during the Class Period: (a) the Company was experiencing sluggish doctor adoption to e-prescribing (b) the Companys claim that it would achieve 1,000 deployed active doctors by t",NON-ACCOUNTING MISREPRESENTATIONS,0,0,0,1,0

Specifically, the representations in the Company's reported results of operations materially overstated Zale's net cash flows and free operating cash flows. In addition, the Company improperly accounted for extended service agreements, leases and accrued payroll. The complaint further alleges that on or around April 10, 2006, before the open of regular trading, the truth began to emerge as Zale announced that the SEC had initiated a broad investigation into many aspects of the Company's accounting, operations and disclosure practices, including Zale's accounting for extended service agreements, leases and accrued payroll, executive compensation and severance, earnings guidance, stock trading and the timing of vendor payments. In reaction to this announcement, the price of Zale stock fell from $27.80 per share on April 7, 2006 to $25.16 per share on April 10, 2006. Then on Friday, May 5, 2006, after the market closed, Zale announced that it had replaced its Chief Financial Officer, Defendant Lenz, after discovering that the Company improperly inflated its reported net cash flows and free cash flows. On this news, the price of Zale stock dropped by $0.44 per share to close at $24.18 on May 8, 2006. On October 17, 2006, the Court entered the Order signed by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer transferring the three similar securities class action from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to the Northern District of Texas. On October 16, 2006, the Court appointed Pipefitters Local No. 636 Defined Benefit Plan, Iron Workers Local 16 Pension Fund and Mitchel Agoos as Lead Plaintiffs, and approved Lead Plaintiffs' selection of Co-Lead and Liaison Counsel. On January 29, 2007, Lead Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities Laws. On March 15, 2007, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint. On April 30, 2007, Lead Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, and on May 21, 2007, Defendants filed a memorandum in reply. On February 29, 2008, a Stipulation of Settlement was filed establishing a proposed settlement fund in the amount of $5,900,000 in cash.  As a result of the proposed settlement, the Court denied the pending motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2008, District Court Judge David C. Godbey preliminarily approved the settlement.  On July 10, 2008, the Court granted the motion for final approval of the settlement and plan of allocation and awarded attorney fees and expenses.
